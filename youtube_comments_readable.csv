"I wonder if a sort of sail-tug could work. I mean, it's like a kite but the ""kite"" stays floating on the water. The main cargo ship does not need any modification, or it could be designed with a smaller engine and fuel tanks.

Each sail-tug superficially looks like a tall sailboat, but there is no keel. Instead, lines to the cargo ship act like kite lines, and the cargo ship's entire hull acts like the ""keel"". Since the lines go horizontally to the cargo ship, there's no heeling even if the sail is very tall.

A sail-tug could be built with less initial investment, and could hook up to different unmodified cargo ship clients on the fly. It's even possible to ""skip"" the time needed to load/unload cargo, by detaching from a client ship about to unload cargo, and immediately hooking up with a different client ship that's departing.",Positive

"They might get a bonus from the government, but they might try something else.  If they put up a one hundred meter by one hundred meter sail in a 120 mph wind, there would be about one billion watts of wind energy trying to get through the ten thousand square meters of the sail area.  If they turned off the engine and sailed downwind, at 30%efficiency, the propeller might generate 300 million watts of electricity.  That is about 1.5 kg of hydrogen per second at 75% efficienct electrolysis. . If they kept a constant heading slightly towards the eye of the hurricane, they would gradualky get closer to the eye wall where the winds are stronger.  The hurricane would carry them for thousands of miles.
If the hurricane lasted ten days, they would generate about a million kg of hydrogen which is the equivalent of about 50,000 barrels of oil or the equivalent of about 20 days ofuel for a container ship.  With the waves always behind them, they would surf down the huge waves instead of slamming the bow into them.  At $10/kg they might make more money just sailing around in hurricanes and tropical storms and selling hydrogen  than they do delivering cargo.
Something much smaller than a cargo ship might accomplish this.  Two parallel cylinders maybe ten meters in diameter and two hundred meters long arranged like a catamaran migh work. With big fins and wing like structures, the two cylinders that are slightly bouyant could slide under the waves down to about 10 meters below the surface with just streamlined, narrow support structures slicing through the 100 foot  waves with little resistance or disturbance from the waves.  
The right kind of prpelkers on the submerged cylinders might get 30% effuciency ior 300 million watts from the available wind energy.  In a season with 10 hurricanes that woukd add up to about a hundred million dollars. Figuring  all of the tropical storms might bring it uo to 200 million.  100 such vessels might make  20 billion dollars wirth of hydrogen in one hurricane season.",Positive

"There is a reason that sailing ships were relegated to tourist boats and historic ships in the worlds navies the moment there was an alternative to sail available.  Sail was gone.

From what I can see climate change is unprovable and all this backwards facing technology is pointless and it only exists to serve a half baked scientific theory that this is all half developed technology based on arguments that are so weak that governments have called it a settled science to avoid arguments and criticism. Climate isn't settled anything. It can not be proved without a time machine. Sailing ships are slow, inefficient, and unreliable as they can only sail when the wind blows.

Hi Over forty years ago when loading a replacement generator down into the engine room I forgot to fully secure the top awning behind the funnel. When the ship sailed the next day the wind pivoted the awning up onto the back of the funnel by a following wind. I had to wait the wind had abated before dropping it back in place. When we calculated the daily figures the propeller slip had changed showing the positive effect the sail had made on the ships performance. It was just a novelty then.  What I can‚Äôt understand why ships don‚Äôt cover their upper decks with solar panels. Container ships could roll out flexible panels on top of the containers to reduce fossil fuel use for the electrical load.  Ex marine engineer,Positive

"lol .. do you really think the sailing ships will make a comeback for commercial shipping?!? Not happening. How are you going to stack literally thousands of containers on ... 4 or more high above deck ... and have the sails be able to catch the wind? Sail would increase costs. The sailing vessel would need a considerably larger crew. Depending on the number of masts, the sailing ship could require a crew at least 10 ... 20 times larger than a diesel powered cargo ship, negating the ""fuel cost savings"".
Clipper ships were replaced by powered cargo ships because the latter were faster, could carry considerably more cargo, and required 1/4 or less crew than a comparable size clipper ship. Also, when the breezes stopped, so did the Clipper Ships. Remember the term ""BECALMED""?  Powered ships are immune to that.

Dream on. For a ship to be profitable it has to carry a certain amount of cargo. The ships get bigger because it costs less to run one ship that can carry 2000 containers than it does two smaller ships that can carry 1000 containers, or four even smaller ships that can only hold 500 containers.

Container ,multi purpose vessels and coasters are the tree primary vessel types that would really benefit from a more environmentally friendly form of propulsion, but due to them being loaded from the top a sail would not work (and because a multi purpose ship often already has cranes). 
Also you kept mentioning klippers (20kn) were faster that modern day shipping, this is true in some sectors but not in the sectors you mentioned.

"While wind based propulsion is tricky for container-ships which need a lot of free space on and above the decks for the container-cranes to do their work, this does not need to be a hurdle for other areas of maritime transport.
Transporting liquids like fuel which can be pumped in and out of the tanks or carrying certain types of bulk goods, depending on their mode of loading and unloading could be done old-school.
There aren't many reasons other than economies of scale and crew wages relative to fuel cost as well as slightly less consistent transport times that would prevent the use of primarily sail-powered transport ships.
While steam engines started to be used in the mid 19th century, sailing transports remained viable well into the 20th century, with ""windjammers"" enjoying popularity up until WWII, so revisiting the windjammer for non-container transport wouldn't even be that far fetched.
Obviously a modern windjammer would require a more conventional auxiliary propulsion system, probably a combustion engine, but even this could be augmented. Say the prop shaft isn't driven directly by the backup engine but is a hybrid-electric system with an array of batteries forming part of the ships ballast. Furthermore, sail area is surface area which could potentially be partially used to capture solar energy to further reduce consumption of combustible fuels by auxiliary generators - even moving only on sails a large transport would still need to keep the lights on and the navigation & communication systems running.",Positive

Commenting before watching the video: Wind powered ships? As an auxiliary power source I assume?,Neutral
"Yes, wind propulsion is way over due.  It has been talked about for at least the last 30 years and not arrived yet so I won't hold my breath.
I hope the flettner rotor ship designers will consider dimples on their rotors.  Golf balls were originally smooth until it was discovered that caddies playing with old knocked about balls flew further.  Thus the dimpled ball was invented.  In the 1970s hexagon dimples were tried and found so sucessful that they were banned!
Wing sails have an advantage over flettner sails in that they do not need continuous power to rotate them (ok they need intermittent power to trim them).  Hopefully they will consider variable camber and slots/flaps for optimal efficientcy.
In either case the sails could incorporate solar cells to power them.
Another alternative, which is perhaps too obvious, is vertical wind turbines driving conventional screw propellers perhaps coupled to the existing shafts.  That is the only tech I can see which would allow the ship to sail directly into wind.
Another tech that may be worth looking at might be coander effect sails.  This would be a variation on the proven technology of the NOTAR helicopter tail booms.
The tea clippers you refer to were square rigged.  They operated most optimally with the wind from the aft quadrants.  They relied for their sucess on the highly detailed wind charts of prevailing strength and direction with time of year compiled in the 1840s.  Two things killed them off commercially, the labour intensive nature of their operation and the Suez canal, mainly the latter, which steam ships were better able to exploit.  The former (labour intensive) could be overcome with powered winches and computer control or some such.  Wind power for ships could be implemented in a modern version.
So called fore and aft rigged ships eg schooner rig sail best into or across the wind, but by that we mean at best about 45 deg (into) to the wind and best at 90 deg (for thrust).  They were incidentally effectively wing sails because they worked on the principle of the curved shape of the canvas forming an aerofoil lifting the ship forward.  Both the technologies you report here will have the same limitations.
A serious consideration for container ships or cruise liners is that to a side wind they are aerodynamic bricks which must suffer considerable leeway (drift down wind) which means the best direction for wing sails or Flettner rotors are worst for leeway.  At least bulk carriers can have a low freeboard so they will be better candidates for these solutions.
Yes the wind should be harnessed to improve their carbon footprint but whatever propulsors are fitted, to work the routes and so on will have to be optimised to the wind and perhaps multiple solutions shoud be used eg wing sails with vertical turbines driving screws.",Positive
The wind sail seems to be the cheaper and more practical solution. After all it will be a high tech return to the roots of shipping.,Positive
"Shipping industry is 2.5% of carbon emissions for the world.
Here's a crazy idea: Get rid of the other 97.5% of emissions first, then look at shipping. And if you really want to start putting a dent in those carbon emissions numbers, let's address the elephant in the room. The biggest polluters in the world are China and India. If we're going to have any hope of shutting down carbon emissions, we're going to have to conquer them and forcibly switch them off of fossil fuels at literal gunpoint. Until those two countries shape up, a carbon neutral world is a pipe dream.",Positive

"Hi Matt, this was a very interesting video to watch which I believe will allow a lot of people to learn and understand more about the challenges for wind propulsion. I am a Naval Architect working in the shipping industry and specifically working on wind assisted propulsion. I would just like to point out a little inaccuracy, the diagram you show at https://youtu.be/MdI191-vNlc?t=443 is slightly incorrect. The Drag as you mention is not necessarily in the opposite direction of movement (if it is, the sail is probably not positioned correctly), what is certain though is that it will always be in the same direction of the apparent wind (which can be in any direction). Therefore, the Thrust (or what we call the forwards direction force) will always be a combination of lift and drag depending on the direction of the apparent wind. For example when running downwind, the sail will be positioned so that it only provides Drag (in the same direction of the apparent wind therefore pushing the ships forwards).

What you may have wanted to refer to was the resistance force that the ship needs to overcome in order to move forward, this is always in the opposite direction of movement. There is a dedicated wikipedia page explaining how all of those forces interact with each other and I think is it fascinating for anyone interested in sailing: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forces_on_sails

Thanks a lot for the video!",Positive
"this makes me think about the YouTube video ""blow your own sails"" i mean it's possible to collect and transmit that energy the big thing is controlling power losses through friction and heat of wiring when docked they could maintain spin to charge batteries for returning to sea and just powering everything dockside with no hookups necessary for dock power  so yeah hybrid system with all the redundancies is best but gotta keep it's weight to power ratio as great as possible autonomy for lazy or cowardly captains and first m8s also being a thing just making it easier although you definitely still need a crew to maintain the ship  and it's control etc I'm talking course corrections etc maybe favorable to travel faster through storms via energy collection possibly robbing the storm of it's destructive force energy sync ing it to accelerate your forward momentum",Positive

"If you‚Äôre shipping goods you‚Äôre already destroying the ecology no matter what fuel you use or if you use no fuel at all. Life giving nutrients function only in a circle so if you draw nutrients into crops or wood products from one area and bring them to another you are depleting the circle. A primary example is farming. Constantly extracting from the prairie to ship food to the cites leaves the prairie depleted. Since 1960 nutrients in the food from modern farming has decreased by almost half for some nutrients and 70 to 90% for others meaning weight gain and a variety of health problems since the food is becoming practically worthless. A much more beneficial way to save on shipping fuel is to not ship. This saves  100% of not only fuel for transport, but all the fuel going into making and maintaining ships and trucks. Human urine and shit are being dumped into the sea which means we‚Äôre literally pissing away the soil nutrients we depend on for life. This negativity affects the sea life we depend on as well.

The owners of the ships aren't the same as the people who pay for the fuel (the renter). As such, a large upfront cost to the owner is hard to justify when the savings go to the renter instead. 
Yes you could say that you should theoretically be able to charge more for renting the ship (as the renter will then recoup those costs in fuel savings), but that is a hard sell to clients looking for low prices. 
Ultimately the renters need to show that they are keen for this type of tech to be installed on ships that they rent, to keep their own fuel costs down, and vote with their pocketbooks, but ultimately it becomes a chicken and egg situation. If these are uncommon, renters won't care and won't seek out the benefit.",Positive

"Hi Matt, I really like your videos & because ships are my business (I'm a marine engineer with 40-years in the industry: 10+ years sailing on ships and the rest operating, repairing, modifying and surveying them) I thought I'd chip in with a few thoughts on this one.
I've always taken a great deal of interest in anything to do with energy-saving or operational efficiency on ships and I'm always keen to evaluate new ideas and equipment and give them a fair but practical shake.  
Some of the data you quoted for the bulk carrier fitted with 4 moveable rotors didn't seem to add up, although I appreciate that the manufacturer probably provided you this data so this is no criticism of you, however; 
78 tons of fuel saved over a period of 518 sailing days, or a 12.5% fuel saving suggests a fuel consumption without the rotors of 624 tons, which is a daily consumption of 1.2 tons/day. This is the daily consumption of the ship's diesel generators, supplying electrical power, not the main engine.
The typical loaded speed range for a ship of this size/type is 12-15 knots with a fuel consumption of 28-35 tons/day depending on vessel speed. Over 518 sailing days the expected fuel consumption would be between 14,504 and 18,130 tons of fuel. 
Even if the rotors saved 78 tons of fuel, this represents only 0.4-0.5% of the expected consumption.
The less than 2-hours to install a rotor also makes me very skeptical too, but the fuel saving figures were a big enough red flag, so I left it there. 
New ideas and equipment are often interesting, with many having practical potential however, it's sometimes difficult not to be cynical about the businesses who are marketing these ideas. 
Thankfully I'm a glass-half-full guy most of the time so I'm not a cynic yet!  
Interesting video nonetheless, thanks for sharing.

Best regards, 
Jack",Positive

Great video. These wind powered ships have been around since 1928. Scientific American has wrote several articles about them since the early 1980's. Not sure if this technology will take hold.

When it comes to something old being made new... why has no one pushed a system like the NASA Stirling Converter. The water is almost always a different temp then the air and if combined with the sails it could wick the heat one way or the other generating energy.

Theirs runs on Nuclear but ours could run on the heat of the environment. plus size could be a no issue. as the unit can be small or large so fitting in may different areas.,Positive

"I don't get all this attention to ""carbon neutral"" shipping and planes. Each time I see it, it's about 3% of global emissions. So, if you want to improves things by 3% you need 100% carbon free ships/planes. Whereas you know, electricity production is just like 20% of global emissions. So if you just put like 1/6th of each coal/gas plant and replace it with solar/wind or hydro, you could do the same reduction with CURRENT tech.
Or you know, regulating packaging. Strangely I never see any numbers related to packaging. We I bet that we could lower our emissions just by not being dumbs or using some properly-laid laws on non-recyclable packaging.

"Thank you for this video! One thing I like about both rotor and wing sail technologies is they can be retrofitted to older ships. That seems like a definite advantage over alternate fuels like hydrogen and ammonia that can only be implemented with redesigns that pretty much require a new ship.

So technologies that can be retrofitted to older vehicles are much more likely to be adopted.

I kind of love the wing sails, and hope they work out.

"Not to sure I'm comfortable with using Ammonia as a fuel for ships. I can see the benefits over hydrocarbons, but the risks of environmental damage in the event of a leak, even a small one, are huge. Ammonia is a corrosive gas at standard temps and pressures. Storing it requires that it be kept pressurized or at cryo temps. Its both toxic to people in moderate concentrations, and highly toxic to marine life and ecosystems in low concentrations. While Anhydrous ammonia gas is lighter than air, when combined with humidity it becomes heavier than air. This is due to it being hygroscopic and readily mixes with water. 
A leak while a ship is in port could be disastrous not just for anyone working or living nearby due to a toxic cloud, but also to the marine environment.
While I think ammonia use as a fuel would be great in some applications, the hazards of its large scale use in shipping far exceeds those of hydrocarbons.

We need a major rethink of our current manufacturing model, like more production in America, and less in Asia. But this raises the price of commodities, and further exacerbates the US inequality issue. It has been demonstrated that inequality is the main cause of the increase in unrest, crime, and violence in our country.",Positive

Would it make sense to mount the sails on the outer edge of the ship?  Perhaps a set of folding or retractible sails along the outer rim of the ship deck would allow for more cargo room?  I don't know how much wider that would make the ship and if that would cause problems.,Negative
"You're comparing tea clipper ""up to"" top speed, in optimal conditions, great winds, and not carrying heavy cargo, which is far far from their typical speed, to current cargo ship typical speed.¬†

Flettner rotors, if there were hard data to support those claims, or ""estimates"" installing flettner rotors would be the most busy business in the world right now.      

The problem with synthetic fuels is that they're very cheap to produce from fossil fuels, and very expensive to produce from electricity. They might become viable if we reach the point where we have almost constant excess of renewable power. You can't base a fuel industry on periods of hours, rarely days, when electric power is cheap.

I think the shipping industry needs to completely redesign the ships, and system. Autonomous multihull ships, carrying very little cargo each, compared to the largest ships in use today, and smaller, but still large enough to fit  l lot of sails, that is also covered in solar cells. And batteries enough to keep at least a decent speed for many hours without sunlight and favourable wind. High initial cost, but negligible operating costs.   

Also, the Bernoulli effect contributes very little to airfoil lift, the main reason wings are designed as they are is to minimise drag. The fact that the Bernoulli effect isn't what keeps planes in the air is proved by the fact that airplanes can fly upside down.  Also, most of the material you used of ""wing sails"" had sails that were symmetrical. Wing shaped sails doesn't solve the reason why sails were replaced by engines, which is in the wind itself, the unreliability of it. Combined with a lot of solar power, and decent battery capacity sails might become commercially viable again.",Positive
Clipper ships were in no way faster than cargo ships. A clipper would only be faster under favourable winds for a very short time. Over a long journey the freighter would kick its ass.

However between the last days of the great clippers and modern container ships, yes the clippers were as fast and faster - but the wind is not reliable.  Just take a look at the worldwide guide for sailing cruisers. Want to leave Vietnam and sail to Australia? (which I'm planning to do in a couple years):  April. That's it. Check the container ship schedules: just about any day of the year.  And clearly I'm a fan of sail.

"In 1870 a premium sailing vessel entered service, the ‚ÄòCutty Sark‚Äô.  The ‚ÄòCutty Sark‚Äô was 64.74 metres in length with a beam of 10.97 metres and a loaded displacement of 2 100 tonnes.  She was able to carry, at best, 1 700 tonnes of cargo and to harness the energy in the wind the available spread of canvas was up to 2 976m2 which was tended by a crew of about 30 skilled men.  The ratio between the sail area (SA) and the vessels displacement (D) determines how lively she was; ‚Äòlively‚Äô being nautical speak for ‚Äòfast and manoeuvrable‚Äô.  The carrying capacity of cargo ships is constrained in two ways, mass and volume which leads us to the ‚Äòstowage factor‚Äô of the cargo; the more mass on board the greater the displacement which in turn impacts the efficiency of the hull form and the sail area / displacement ratio.  A vessel constrained by mass is said to be ‚Äòdown but not full‚Äô, while a vessel constrained by volume is said to be ‚Äòfull but not down.  When in the tea trade, which the ‚ÄòCutty Sark‚Äô was designed and built for with fine lines (more nautical tech speak, so again no need to worry about it) she could carry around 600 tonnes of cargo at speeds of up to 17.5 knots dependent on the prevailing wind and had a typical China to UK time on passage of 120 days.  The tea trade was very competitive so ‚Äòtime on passage‚Äô was a large factor in securing the premium freight rate that made the ‚ÄòCutty Sark‚Äô cost effective.  Rounding things out, her maximum available sail area gave circa 5m2 of canvas for every tonne of tea carried.  As soon as the Suez Canal opened, which the ‚ÄòCutty Sark‚Äô was unable to sail through; she lost her advantage, raw speed, to the steam powered ships of that era who could beat her ‚Äòtime on passage‚Äô by taking that short cut.  Mechanically powered ships have improved in terms of efficiency, on a freight tonne mile basis, by at least one order of magnitude since then.  After losing out to the coal burning, fire tube boiler, steam reciprocating mechanical ships of the late 19th century ‚ÄòCutty Sark‚Äô was relegated to the Australian wool trade, just about the bottom of the barrel in maritime terms and only one small step up from being a 'honey barge'.",Positive

"I‚Äôve looked into wingsails quite a bit as an upgrade for more traditional sails on personal craft. I‚Äôm betting you‚Äôve seen how hard it is to research this topic (need a better name for the tech to separate from other things).
Have you looked at kite sails? The claim there is wind is more powerful at 200 ft than surface. Deep dive will uncover long YouTube video from startup that researched stationary kite sails for energy production. There is a company that has a system for large commercial ships and supposedly an electric boat company is going to use them.
The story I want to hear is why commercial boat makers who announced 10 years ago to have wingsails on production models no longer discuss the topic. What happened? What did they learn?",Positive
"Couple of points. Firstly, wind powered ships need a large auxiliary engine to minimize delay risk. Second, unless mandated, payback of 2 or 3 years is needed to ensure widespread uptake.

Wonder what the issues are and whether anyone is working on this ?",Positive

"Wind power is the way to go for shipping as it has been in the 1800 century‚Äôs. But we will need big change in the economy in order to go this way. First sadly all the fossil fuel will have to be burned, then, with the climate change,  the human population will collapse to a more sustainable level Then it will become obvious that consuming goods from the other side of the planet will be unrealistic with no fuel. The wind power will become the only way to power ships. In the mean time unless the fuel cost skyrocket and make those technology payback in a year or so, it will stay in the ¬¥exotic‚Äô side of the shipping industry. When only wind turbine, solar panels and maybe nuclear will be the only source of energy, human will stop wasting energy like they do at the moment. Thermal engines are only 50% thermal efficient at the most. This means that a 10MW engine waste 10MW of heat into the atmosphere to run.",Negative

Biofuels still emit carbon dioxide - supposedly carbon neutral, but remember much of that carbon is sequestered naturally, green ammonia and methanol, like hydrogen are going to be very expensive to manufacture.

In narrow areas like docks and waterways on uses an all electric battery and electric more setup. During open water sailing the battery pack can be used to power all the electrical systems and safety systems as well.

Have you seen the size of engines and their fuel tanks on these big ships?  They are huge!

Batteries would also be less polluting than fuel in the light of accidents/spillages.  Plus there's the almost constant opportunity to recharge the batteries from solar and wind enroute.

If they cargo i that light and expensive it would likely be shipped by air and not by a boat.

Wind powered boats will cost far more to build, carry far less cargo, be slower on 99% of the trade routes, and be unreliable.

"To assert that wind powered ships are faster is somewhat disingenuous.  Sailing ship water speed is highly dependent on the point of sail, broad reaching being usually the fastest.  However, the wind does not blow at a constant speed or direction which in combination with water currents greatly affects how long and what it costs to move from port to port.  In addition many ships need to move through waterways such as the Suez and Panama canals.  The use of such short cuts is  usually impractical under sail and rendered the clippers uncompetitive on the routes they were designed to work.
There was at least one experimental hybrid wind powered commrercial ship built around 1970's using rigid sails, in reaction to the OPEC induced oil crisis, the object being to reduce consumption of expensive fuel, I actually saw it once but cannot find any record of it.

"The thing to remember for all wind powered shipping developments is that they are supplementary. Currently wing sails look to be the most promising, despite their absurd efficiency claims. The main barriers to adoption seems to be speed and  complexity. Mainly because faster shipping = more volume = more profit; whereas slower shipping = less volume = eats up cost efficiency. space and weight are actually secondary concerns.

For alternate fuels it runs the other way; fuel space, weight, and cost are generally higher, for equivalent power, and availability is lower. Even once infrastructure is built out, and tech is improved, there are still some permanent losses to capacity that are more noticeable for early adopters which will hamper rollout until the  previous methods become more costly (either through diminishing supply, or most major powers progressively taxing them)",Neutral

When I was a kid, I read about a company that used liquid nitrogen onboard a car, to spun a turbo-generator, which charged the batteries, and then on to an electric motor, of course. Seemed a marvelous idea to me at the time, and seems like an even better idea now. Nitrogen can be concentrated from the air, using renewable power; it's easy to store, transport, and use; it's as safe as you can get, barring asphyxiation; no CO2 in any way; and free air-conditioning for your car.

"Okay hear me out, what about submersible tug drones in a parachute style to pull the ships along with the currents? 

Or retractable solar roofs above the cargo? I'm thinking 3 sections(over hanging the port and starboard sides) suspended by steel cabling on the Bow and Stern. Folding the panels in an accordion fashion with the wing portions further folding around the super structure to tuck them into the footprint of the ship for port. The folding mechanism would also be useful if protecting the panels in bad weather and for maintenance/cleaning/removal of debris. 

And retractable outriggers to widen the footprint of the ship when in open water, reducing drag by making the water move less to get around the Bow of the ship(a similar reasoning behind the bulb found below the water off the bow. To more efficiently split the water around the hull of the ship. But the larger the size of the bulb the further and single molecle of has to travel in a given time/distance. This means that for as the ship/bulb gets larger the water most accelerate more to exit the path of the ship increasing drag. My idea is rather than one hull, make it three to reduce the distance a single molecule has to travel to exit the path of a single hull)
The outriggers would also allow for the propulsion and fuel storage to be moved to them freeing up space in the main hull for cargo.",Positive

"√è remember hearing about a company proposing using giant automated kites at the front of ships, basically kitesurfing on steroids. Are they still around?  Anything that has the potential to lower the shipping companies bottom line has a good chance of seeing good adoption. Cargo ships have pretty much all adopted slow steaming to reduce their fuel costs by moving slower. For this reason I'm skeptical of the biofuels avenue. Ships run on the cheapest dirtiest sludge to remain cost-competitive. It's doubtful any form of synthetic fuel would get competitive with bottom-of-the-barrel sludge. If they can manage it, though, that would be revolutionary and fix a lot of problems, since it would likely be a desirable fuel for all forms of transportation then.",Positive
"I guess this question applies to both fletner rotors and sails; I noticed on the pilot project ship that the fletner rotors were offset from the center axis of the ship to the port side. Unless I am not understanding the physics, the thrust will be generated perpendicular to the vertical axis of the rotor, which means if that axis is offset from center and is on the port side, that thrust will cause the ship to want to turn to port. That would necessitate that the rudder would need to compensate for this by being turned slightly starboard if the ship is to sail straight. This would cause additional drag and reduce the efficiency gains from the rotor. If I am correct, is the purpose of the offset rotors a trade-off to provide more space for, and make it easier to load and unload, cargo? Likewise though, this seems like it would also cause an inconvenience because loading and unloading cargo would be more easily done from the starboard side.",Positive

Yes, using the wind to help sounds as a doable and practical idea. Problem is that most business people want a payback period of 3-4 years.

wrong direction for your cargo delivery needs and sometimes there is rather too much of it for comfort.¬† Traditional sailing
ships are unable to go directly up wind so if the wind is blowing from the direction your cargo needs to go then a zig-zag course must be steered, more distance and thus more time on passage at whatever speed is achieved.¬† Wind speed is traditionally measured on the Beaufort Scale (wind speed) that runs from 0 (< 1kn or 0.5ms) to 12 (> 63kn or 32.5ms) and for sailing purposes the usable part of the range is ‚Äò3‚Äô (circa 8kn or 4.1ms) to ‚Äò6‚Äô (circa 24kn or 12.3ms).¬† As the wind speed, and the amount of energy that may be harvested there from, increases the sea surface becomes progressively more disturbed which makes the harvesting process ever more difficult and increasing the stress on the vessel.",Negative

"Probably the biggest issue with wind for shipping has to do with the unpredictability of winds along certain routes, potentially affecting shipping timetables (delays compound because at the destination port, there will be cargo for loading as well). Reliability in this regard is part of why steam and gas motor power overtook sail power in the 19th/20th century, along with the reduced crew needed to run these ships. Clippers were a streamlined hull/sail design that weren't in use until steamships were already widespread, and they remained in use along specific, reliable tea routes in which speed was of utmost importance. One of the best ways to mitigate shipping pollution not discussed here is to reduce international trade..

Your explanation to why airplane wings create lift is incorrect.,Positive
"Wind is vastly untapped recourse on ships. I hope they continue and expands testing both rotor design and wing design applications.

I have another belief of how to explain airplane lift.
As the wing pass through the air it will be:
1 forced by underside of the wing to move down (positive air pressure) and the wing will capture and opposite reaction upwards, witch we call lift.
2 flowing over the wing. The ""Coanda"" effect makes the air keep following the curved surface covering the top of the wing downwards action - and create (negative air pressure) an opposite reaction upwards = more lift.

The Coanda effect can easy be demonstrated by holding a round object for ex a bottle tilted on the side under water tap and see how the water follow the curved surface and may leave the bottle at an angle opposite side from where the water hit the bottle.",Neutral

"There‚Äôs no doubt that a cargo ship from the future will need to use wind power. Anything else is flat out incompetent. Of course they will also need some other power, but taking more than 80% of propulsive power from the wind is easily achievable without any new knowledge whatsoever. The rotating ‚Äúwing‚Äù is a dead end. The efficiency is stupid low. The only reason they are not rejected is that engineers feel better about things that look like machines and have a seemingly cool way of working. 

It‚Äôs quite easy to make a mainly sailing cargo vessel that can move fast and have reliable passage times. It needs to have an actual boat designer look at the shapes and functionality. Present cargo ships are designed predominantly as industrial units, where total efficiency is disregarded. If a cargo plane was designed with the same mindset, it could never fly. 

The hull and superstructure needs to be streamlined, have little windage. Cargo must be inside the ship, not stacked on top of it. The under water parts must be better than just cargo boxes. They need to be seen as actual vessels. Probably foldable leeboards are needed, as a dramatically more efficient way of limiting leeway. Also an easy solution, that has been in use on sailing cargo ships in northern Europe for 600 years. Soft wing rigs or rigid ones that can be lowered is the right setup for propulsion. Airplanes use wings, because that‚Äôs the only usable option. The task on a ship is exactly the same one. 

The cargo ships of today are so poorly configured because there was no motivation for not being extremely wasteful. Now there is. If shipping is presented with the true bill for their wastefulness, they will clean up in the blink of an eye. As mentioned, all necessary knowledge has been available for decades, much of it even for centuries. There‚Äôs no excuse anymore.",Positive

"Steel sailing ships called Windjammers demonstrated 98% sail propulsion and were commercially profitable into the 1920‚Äôs. Modern aero hydrodynamics and larger ships will be enough to bring back sailing as the dominant propulsion because it‚Äôs both faster and cheaper. You may be skeptical, but observe how the UK is competitively employing vast wind turbine farms in the North Atlantic to transform their economy to a more efficient and self reliant one. The three blades on each turbine are just sails that turn a generator that convey power to a battery in an electric truck that conveys cargo. A sailboat is just a simpler, more efficient and larger wind powered conveyance.

"Here's my proposal to phase out bunker fueled ships: Do not attempt to retrofit existing cargo ships, or build new sailing cargo ships to replace existing fleets - there isn't enough time, shipping companies are fully invested, and each Maersk class ship pollutes more than 50,000,000 cars. Instead, mass produce semi-submersible, ocean circulating catamaran tugs with huge wing sail arrays on both hulls. The point would be to tow any ship by using maximum sail power wherever possible to reduce bunker fuel consumption by 60-80 percent ASAP.  Replacing legacy Panamax and Maersk size ships with sailing versions is simply impractical enough to be impossible and a huge distraction from solving the problem immediately. Economics are simple: the value of saved fuel pays for the sailing tugs and towing service. Theoretically, existing cargo ships will continue to operate up to existing life expectancies without impacting schedules or port activity.

Semi-submersible catamaran hulls will be more stable, efficient and capable of delivering more wind power than dicey retrofit sail kits, as well as more robust for weathering storms. Mounting arrays of large wing sails on two hulls allows for significant structural cross-bracing. Huge tow lines can be floated on retractable, inflatable tubes to connect tug to cargo ship at standardized attachment points at strong points near the waterline on bows. The sail tugs would rotate crews offshore and remain at sea towing customer ships like barges more-or-less continuously. Ships connect any distance offshore, throttle back during crossings, then disconnect at any economically optimum point to continue motoring to port....",Positive

"Ships can soon now go fusion nuclear with no fuel costs! The SAFIRE GENERATOR by Aureon Energy Ltd. of Canada is the actually cheapest, cleanest and least expensive solution for clean electricity. Wind energy, solar, hydro and other green technologies are now just superseded. Hydrogen will not either become a future conventional fuel but a nuclear fusion one! Electric power is the future for autonomous small aircraft and with ever more battery energy storage density perhaps some larger ones. However, FUSION NUCLEAR IS THE FUTURE of ever-larger commercial and military aircraft. Now we have a 24 hr. reliable fusion power product. We now in 2021 have super cheap nuclear fusion energy already proven and almost commercialised as in being in advanced production, that of the ""SAFIRE GENERATOR"". So sadly, storage technologies and the power from ITER-type fusion power generators as well as conventional fission nuclear are going to be eclipsed. Current magnetic plasma confinement strategies and all current green energy technologies are totally out of date and relatively redundant. All our effort must now go into EVER HIGHER ENERGY DENSITY BATTERIES because green energy is now solved. With intermittent green energies we need an enlarged electric grid, so we see wind generators, solar farms and a multitude of variable green technologies with expensive backup batteries and they are all ugly and use up much land, while also being significantly capital intensive and all while having some safety issues. They are all also going to be unnecessary with the advent of the ""SAFIRE GENERATOR"" that is safe, costlessly self-fueling, totally green, buildable on any scale on a tiny footprint to safely match local community requirement and it is easily chokeable and 24 hours dependable.

"The argument that owners do not pay for the fuel falls well short of the shipping reality. Charterers will always seek the transportation solution which is both time-relevant and cheap and believe me their knowledge on ship propulsion consumption is very deep. By simply installing a more efficient fuel atomization system in the engine and cutting consumption by 2% an owner automatically makes their ship more competitive; it‚Äôs reasons like this that have helped push older ships out of business (well, that along with new pollution prohibiting legislation).
As you point out speed is the culprit for wind propulsion. In my opinion hydrogen may become the only legitimate solution in the intermediate term unless electrical power storage becomes MUCH more dense and fast recharging",Positive
"There is a hidden message here. Wind powered ships went out of use because carbon powered vessels are quicker and not so prone to the unpredictable weather. If the cargo is perishable then this is very important but if it is non perishable then why should the time of the voyage be so important? Because while the cargo is on the sea it is not earning any income for the investment. Somebody buys 10,000 tonnes of metal ore on one side of the world and wants to transport it to a factory or mill on the other side of the world where it will be transformed into saleable goods. The longer it takes for the cargo to move from the mine into finished saleable goods the longer the investor goes without income from that investment. This is the capitalist system. We need to be looking at an economic system not so based upon time is money as then slower sailing ships will be viable.

We also need to look very closely at nuclear powered shipping. People get very upset when we mention nuclear power because they associate it with nuclear bombs and nuclear waste. the association with nuclear bombs is largely a result of ignorance and disappear when the method of operation of nuclear ships is understood. The problem of nuclear waste is important but with care it is controllable. In the history of nuclear power the number of people killed is by any estimate less than 60,000 in the past 70 years. this sounds a lot but should be balanced against the hundreds of thousands dying each year from atmospheric pollution caused by fossil fuels. The effect of nuclear power on climate change is close to zero.",Negative

"Slow cruising is a shipping industry phenomenon that makes a return to wind power seem logical. Essentially, especially at times when there is excess shipping capacity... more boats than are economically needed... it makes sense for ship lines to purposely cruise much below their ships' maximum speed.

At a time when the industry is increasingly learning to go slower, it makes sense to capitalize on that fact by getting a free lift from the wind.",Positive

Sail is good for powering small light vessel. Introduction of power driven vessel was because the need for constant power. Also it would interupt global economics. Introducing this things on deck is increasing maintenance , creates additional impact on stability, gives extra work for crew, increasing danger for crew. Kites are good while they fly. What would happen if system malfunctions, kite flls into sea and steel wire/ wire gets around propeller shaft or if this flys over the deck and cuts someons head off?

Nowdays all oceangoing vessels are using scrubbers. All what is going to air is vapor. We also abandoned one time use plastics, use more and more LNG fuel or hybrid propulsions, we are compacting and burning garbage (except plastic which is delivered to shore) so vessels are geting very green.

The rotor ships still consume fuel (~5-10%) (albeit recycled heat is being used) and yet are only equivalent of an aerofoil.

"dude, i like the fact that you are not selling this as the future and are sceptical of the results, especially when they claim 90%. I think we are very far from renewable energy on big forms of transports (lorries, ships, planes,...). the reason is, all these are designed to have a (relatively) small engine compared to the full cargo. for example, if you think of a ship, probably the engine is 5% of the total size, together with the tanks maybe 10%, same for planes. Of course you can have an electric car because the current petrol engine uses almost 1/3 of the car (the front of back part) so a 1 to 1 transition is not a bad thing.
About the kite, I really doubt it can be a feasible solution, simply because the ropes will need to be so ultra resistant that I doubt will be able to pull an entire vessel full of containers and in any case will reduce the emissions (as you mentioned) by 10% maximum, even by optimising them at their best.",Positive

THE HUMANS ARE UNCAPPABLE TO CONTROL or CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY THE GLOBAL CLIME, this is pseudoscience. And is a narrative used to control the oil usage in subdeveloped countrys so as yours, is all about capital and resources controled by big companies and governments.


THE SUN is who control the global atmosphere temperature, and the CO2 doesn‚Äôt control or change temperature, this is the biggest lie of this agenda, just go to desert and see if any gases keeps heat energy without the sun or umidity, and our emissions aren‚Äôt even close of those from OCEAN, who is the real controler of CO2 (and are disconnected with clime variation). Anyway the CO2 variates with OCEAN TEMPS AND NOT THE OPPOSITE. And the Green house effect is an wrong and old theory that is being reviewed in climatology bcause data is telling other story.

"To address the suggestions that sail power is the answer I offer the following example.  In 1870 a premium sailing vessel entered service, the ‚ÄòCutty Sark‚Äô.  The Cutty Sark was 64.74 metres in length with a beam of 10.97 metres and a loaded displacement of 2 100 tonnes.  She was able to carry 1 700 tonnes of cargo and to harness the energy in the wind the available spread of canvas was up to 2 976m2 which was tended by a crew of about 30 skilled men.  A ratio between the sail area (SA) and the vessels displacement (D) determines how lively she is; ‚Äòlively‚Äô being nautical speak for ‚Äòfast and manoeuvrable‚Äô.  The carrying capacity of cargo ships is constrained in two ways, mass and volume which leads us to the ‚Äòstowage factor‚Äô of the cargo; the more mass on board the greater the displacement which in turn impacts the efficiency of the hull form and sail area / displacement ratio.  A vessel constrained by mass is said to be ‚Äòdown but not full‚Äô, a vessel constrained by volume ‚Äòfull but not down.  When in the tea trade, which the ‚ÄòCutty Sark‚Äô was designed and built for with fine lines (more nautical tech speak so again - no need to worry about it) she could carry around 600 tonnes of cargo at speeds of up to 17.5 knots dependent on the prevailing wind and had a typical China to UK time on passage of 120 days.  The tea trade was very competitive so ‚Äòtime on passage‚Äô was a large factor in securing the premium freight rate that made her cost effective.  Rounding things out her maximum available sail area gave circa 5m2 of canvas for every tonne of tea carried.

As soon as the Suez Canal opened, which the ‚ÄòCutty Sark‚Äô was unable to sail through; she lost her advantage, raw speed, to the steam powered ships of that era who could beat her ‚Äòtime on passage‚Äô.  Mechanically powered ships have improved in terms of efficiency, on a freight tonne mile basis, by at least one order of magnitude since then.  After losing out to the coal burning, steam reciprocating mechanical ships of the late 19th century ‚ÄòCutty Sark‚Äô was relegated to the Australian wool trade, just about the bottom of the barrel in maritime terms and only one small step up from being a 'honey barge'.  The canvas, cordage and extra manpower needed for sailing ships was never a very benign environmental option so please discount any idea of sail as ‚Äòsustainable‚Äô.  All this is without the problem that if ‚Äòthe wind don‚Äôt blow the ship don‚Äôt go‚Äô, when it does blow it often blows in the wrong direction for your cargo delivery needs and sometimes there is rather too much of it for comfort.

Random facts about ‚ÄòCutty Sark‚Äô, it is said to have been possible to coax 3 000 horse power out of her sails, or in ‚Äòreal money‚Äô 2 206 500 Watts (2.2 megaWatts), in those elusive ideal conditions or 741 Watts for each square meter of sail area.  So that majestic spread of canvas would have been even less efficacious for delivering your baubles and bows from the orient, despite taking about 120 days on the voyage.",Positive

I think electric power generated from wind are more liekly to be used more on ships than some of these technologies.,Neutral
"Blocking of other airfoils isn't the only reason wind from behind isn't good, it's also because the speed of the ship reduces the relative speed of the wind, but with wind from the side the relative speed is equal to the actual windspeed. Although if the ship speed is very small compared to the windspeed this effect is minimised.",Negative
"I mean speed isn't really the main reason why sails went out of favor it was actually manpower. A traditional sail ship requires a large crew to manage the sails as it is a task that at the time was not very easily automated. Whereas a coal fired ship only requires stokers and engineers to manage the engine, and stoking can be automated, and oil requires none of those. Modern freight ships have only about a dozen crew members at most on even the largest ones. Cargo ships these days aren't exactly fast either and usually spend most of their time running at a fraction of their top speed, rarely actually going much faster than sailing ships used to do.",Positive

"when you say 3% of emission do you mean total or just the human emission, you know that ships are estimated to emit 50% CO2 emission from humans, and a diesel engine on a ship consumes about 1-2tonn of Diesel Per 1000KW per hour and container ships generally has a motor of at least 20MW, this means that a ship uses more diesel or heavy fuel than a car does in it's lifetime even if the car runs and function for more than 30 years, in just a hour(this depends on the motor size). and the NOX/SOX is being done something about with improvements to the motor design and exsost filtration systems.",Positive

"People seem to forget that the main reason it used to take so long to get any where by sail is not because of the speed but because of the fact that part way along your journey, you might have to stop because there is no usable wind.

I mean, all those dead miners rotting in the trenches would be a problem. So they developed the wind columns similar to these ones you saw on the first ship Illustrated here. These were used as an auxiliary power, to propel the ship forward when conditions were favorable. I understand that they cut down fuel consumption by 60% in this way. The reason they did not continue to be used, is that the coal shortage was resolved eventually and prices for coal went down.",Negative

"Almost 50 years ago, when I was a young sailor, the world was in fear of running out of oil.  There were all sorts of articles and books written about it, and among the solutions for the future, there was a great deal of talk about bringing back wind-powered ships, including some designs that utilized the airfoil type sails described.   Those fears were pure BS, just like the great global demise by CO2 is pure BS, but that's another issue.  I loved the idea, having encountered a few sailing vessels in the Middle East and the Indian Ocean (there was a wrecked one in the harbor approaches to Victoria, Seychelles, that was fascinating), and would have loved to ship on one, but I got a chance to make a good living in a place where no one would recognize an anchor, and I took it, and meantime, those technical wonder sailing ships never showed up.   I don't believe they ever will, at least not on this planet.  Wind and solar are nice feel-good solutions that don't really work, though as propulsion, wind is at least viable, but we are a clever species, and unless we decide to devolve into some sort of global soviet union-style civilization, we will find a more efficient way than wind power.",Positive

Wind power to drive ships is primitive technology,Neutral
Forcing compressed air to create a vacuum bubble around the hull similar to that being used in submarines and torpedoes in conjunction with wind power devices and bio fuel engines to support pumps will introduce a new era in sailing.  This is being engineered and will be floated on a mega yacht under design to prove the concept.  Expect 90% decreases in consumption.  Cruise speeds are expected increase to increase from 100% to 150% with structural hull loads expected to be the limiting factor. Container cargo will be completely enclosed in upcoming designs much like stealth fighters and bombers such as the B-2 bomber and Y-22 and F-35 fighters. These vessels will resemble blink like fast moving structures at high speeds over the water and significantly faster by 50% in rough sea swells.  Enjoy your preview.,Positive

"I think the owner/leaser conundrum is not true: if sails reduce fuel costs then a ship owner could have them installed and lease the ship at a higher rate, thereby paying off the investment.

"Enercon Eship is using a Flettner for 10 years and claims 10-15% reduction in fuel. Surprised you didn't include it as the longest running project next to Skysail. A Flettner has a Ca lift coefficient of 34 vs a wing having a Ca of 4. Control systems for a single force by angle of attack is fairly common today. The Flettner generates way more lift to save fuel and is easier to shut down in storm by shutting off it's rotaion. Stuck or mangled telescopic wings are a SOLAS safety concern to people. A wing is still an active wing always directing it's resulting force somewhere. 

If you ship a reefer container (huge 40t fridge) full of nitrogen atmosphere stored Avocado, it's all a messy rotten waste arriving just 2 days late. Insurance pays or doesn't pay out 40 M USD in damages htting no wind conditions. So full sail isn't the main idea, IMO  MARPOL regulations and saving fuel is. Wallenius is doing RoRo of cars. High value goods where overall CO2 lifecycle fleet emissions regimes apply to consumer product. Car makes are fined for missing fleet emission targets. So the ocean Bird busness model is a bit skewed in favour of this. A RoRo doesn't use container bridges in congested urban port areas, where landuse is already maxed out for efficiency, automation and flexibility.

Most ship owners plan for Bio or eFuels to blend in and gradually replace bunker oil. Aerofoil sails It's certainly a topic awaited to mature in special purpose newbuilds first rather than retrofits.
Overcapacty has plagued shipping makets for 2 decades of crisis now. people are vary on experiments unless they are backed by gov R&D funds. Industry people basically pray for older less efficients ships being forcibly retired by CO2 regimes. Pension funds invested in these ships don't. Ship design is one of the slowest moving industries in adopting new tech. A ship cost millions and losing one to accident is still common and ocean waters are rough on wearing out any tech. Plus lifes of crew are at stake next to massive losse sof cargo and mad customers impacted by spare parts, medicals, fertilizers, food or key electric components not arriving on schedule.

A smaller ferry operator has more freedom and better funding to experiment. But these people aren't excatly flush in funds either.
Actually such tech risks turned from increasing the funding risk to decreasing it by making the future profitablitiy outlook under C02 emission outlook more favorable to banks and funds.
That's a huge boost to these add on fuel saving systems. It all starts with selling the idea to the bank or fund behind the newbuild.

Our take is eFuels from tidal power simply replace the diesel. That pays off when you factor in where you create renewables and need to use them and how cheap they can be this way. Pls. find out more  https://youtu.be/nqbVTVMSSTM",Positive

You mentioned a rotating-cylinder-system in order to harness wind power. A long time ago I read about this invention: the Flettner Rotor! It was tested aroubd 1925 but failed  - the main point  being that driving the rotor cost more energy than it created usable energy for propulsion... What to make of that?,Positive
"To address the suggestions that sail power is the answer I offer the following.  In 1870 a premium sailing vessel entered service, the ‚ÄòCutty Sark‚Äô, she could carry around 600 tonnes of cargo at speeds of up to 17.5 knots, dependent on the prevailing wind, to harness the energy the available spread of canvas was up to 2 976m2.  To round things out that was circa 5m2 of canvas for every tonne of cargo carried.  The ‚ÄòCutty Sark‚Äô was designed and built for employment in the tea trade where speed was a large factor in securing the premium freight rate but as soon as the Suez Canal opened, which the ‚ÄòCutty Sark‚Äô was unable to sail through, she lost her advantage to the steam powered ships of that time.  Mechanically powered ships have improved in terms of efficiency, on a freight tonne mile basis, by at least one order of magnitude since then.  After losing out to the coal burning, steam reciprocating mechanical ships of the late 19th century ‚ÄòCutty Sark‚Äô was relegated to the Australian wool trade, just about the bottom of the barrel in maritime terms and only one small step up from being a 'honey barge'.  The canvas, cordage and extra manpower needed for sailing ships was never a zero cost option so please discount any idea of sail as ‚Äòsustainable‚Äô in environmental terms.  All this is without the problem that if ‚Äòthe wind don‚Äôt blow the ship don‚Äôt go‚Äô, when it does blow it often blows in the wrong direction for your cargo delivery needs and sometimes there is rather too much of it for comfort.",Positive

"""Is wind power the future of shipping?"" Probably not. But a nice contribution to lower fuel consumption for some special applications. 
What is not mentioned in most concepts: The sails just work/contribute at comparatively low cruising speeds. I know the head and owner of former Beluga shipping company (we won an Environmental price together), and his former company was specialized on heavy transportation. In this business, the handling of unique, very heavy cargo (like big mining machinery or generators) is superior to travel speed; that's why the skysail concept has been interesting to him.

It is not far-fetched that based on these principals that conceptually, a solution with a large collective area of aerofoils would outperform the other two solutions maybe even by a large amount.

On the aero foil solutions I don't see that working at all.

"Wind-powered ships either means slow ships, or hybrids of some sort.  Speaking generally, wind-power also eats into cargo space on a ship.  Kites are an exception; not much cargo space is used.  But the tech isn't mature.

Slow ships mean more product is locked up in transportation.  The 'pipeline' is longer.  Not advantageous.  I don't expect that many ships will ever be constructed which rely solely on wind power for cargo transportation.

What sort of hybrids could we talking about?  As batteries improve, electric propulsion for ships will expand.  Japan is already building a small fleet of electric ships for coastal shipping.  They can't go the distance on long international routes, but coastal shipping is not insignificant.  And as part of hybrid propulsion systems, batteries will probably play an increasing role.  With added sails, a kite, and hydrogen fuel cells, a ship should be able to attain reasonable speeds without emissions, while the batteries and fuel cells will prevent a hybrid ship from being stalled for lack of wind.

Hydrogen isn't an efficient way to store and use energy, and it won't rival fuel oil for cost, but it's still an option for a hybrid, as not all of the energy required to drive a hybrid will be expensive once the initial capital investment is made.  Wind energy will be free to harvest, and grid electricity is cheaper even than fuel oil.

Today's cargo ships have terrible aerodynamics.  They're basically blocks mounted on a hull.  So when we speak of reducing emissions, aerodynamics is a dimension to consider.  We can cut down emissions simply by streamlining cargo ships, in principle.  Some new concepts for stowage may need to be developed.  Containers simply aren't aerodynamic.

Another dimension is the immense need globalization imposes on our civilization for shipping.  This is temporary - a phase we are going through.  Tech advances will likely reduce the need, and the economic justification, for centralized production.  For an example of how a company can plan to reduce reliance on shipping, look no further than the auto industry, which often sites factories to serve geographical locations.  Looking further ahead, tech such as 3-D printing may advance to the point where many things communities need can be easily produced in low volumes locally.  Advances in robotics, AI and 3-D printing may ultimately lead us - in the long term - to microfactories which can flexibly make many things, not just one thing, and do so economically at local scales.  We may need fewer ships in future decades as these trends play out.


We'll still need to move raw materials around, of course.  And food, probably, though there is potential for vertical farms serving communities which lack sufficient farmland to produce what they need.

There is, as you pointed out, an obstacle to overcome.  Ship owners don't pay for fuel for cargo shipments, so they have no incentive to reduce fuel expenditures.  But this is easily resolved by government action.  It just needs legislation and incentives.

I think the only certainty here is that we must, and will, begin to reduce emissions from cargo shipping.  Exactly how that will play out isn't easy to predict.  There are a lot of moving parts, and technologies still remain to be developed.  Falling battery prices and maturing tech alternatives will play a role.",Positive

"Nuclear powered ships are potentially the best answer to this problem.

"Its an interesting mathematical symmetry the best that can be done with auxiliary wind powered cargo vessels is about a 10% reduction in fuel consumption, but with a competitive purely wind powered vessel you would need ten times more vessels.  Things don't always scale linearly.  Surface area of a sail is what generates lift/thrust.  the volume, mass, and surface area of hull is what generates both drag and revenue.  That square is not easy to circle.

What few people realize - people who are not sailors - is that being able to quickly reduce you 'sailing' capacity is crucial for success because the worlds oceans are full of huge storms that travel much faster than even if you and if you miss the worst burnt of these storms, they can still destroy you 'sailing' equipment, maybe even your vessel.  Not good.

Even during the day of the 'windjammmers' the largest, and last, of the pure wind powered cargo vessels the could only economically carry bulk cargoes over long enough distances that other ships were uneconomical:  cotton from Australia, lumber, coal. petroleum oil & etc.

The ultimate problem is a cube-square law problem driving an energy density problem.  Past a certain - a very small size by contemporary standards - vessels cannot be powered purely by wind and keep up.

"There is nothing new under the sun. Until 120 years ago, wind power dominated shipping.

And of course ships are huge structures which can themselves carry solar panels and the aerofoils mentioned in this video.",Positive

"Ziroth -You bring up some good points and you are wise to be skeptical of claims.  The 8% cut in fuel consumption is much more realistic in the real world with no big behavior change and that does not impress anyone.  The big reason wind power is not getting more attention is that there is a worldwide treaty banning taxation of ship fuel.  By comparison, the auto industry has spent hundreds of billions of dollars cutting emissions and increasing efficiency.  Shipping is atrocious by comparison.  Just this past year they finally put regulations on the Sulphur content of fuel oil -on land it was banned decades ago for contributing to acid rain.  If you look at pollution as a global problem it is obvious that shipping contributes the most pollution with the least regulation and spending.  Put another way, that 8% reduction from one ship is greater than the savings from thousands of cars upgraded at a cost of tens of millions.
If we charged as much for pollution from ships as we do from cars, ALL ships would use wind and solar and production would be localized.

"wind simply is not the most economical system for removing emmissions from these vessels. wind relies on, shockingly, wind. it also takes up deck space,  costs too much, and the afformentioned issue with the charters. in reality, we have had a better solution for a long, long time: nuclear. many US navy ships are already powered by nuclear reactors, which create no emmisions. they also do not need fueling more than every 10+ years. the problem is insurance. when you put something that could explode on your ship and cause an ecological disaster, insurance skyrockets. however, we can make nuclear reactors that do not explode; we just need to use thorium reactors. unlike uranium, thorium is not fissile by itself and needs a small amount of plutonium in order to become fissile. this means that if shit hits the fan and it reaches the conditions where uranium powerplants explode, you can drain the thorium into another tank. no explosion. but what if the ship sinks? then build a reactor that can keep the radioactive bits contained until it can be extracted by a salvage operation; besides, ships do not sink that often anymore. a ship usually just goes from point A to point B for 40 years and is then broken up and made into another ship.",Negative

"They face all the same reasons the world stopped using wind propulsion. Sea states above 5, doldrums,  slow speeds, and hurricane avoidance to name just a few. It's not that we can't design/build a sailing ship, it is that we can't make one with the same capabilities as a modern-day diesel-fueled or nuclear ship of any significant displacement. Sure, build them light, yes, but, at some point I see them restricted to low deadweight capacity. And that means world trade and shipping companies would be taking a big hit in its industry and we all know what happens to the world when that happens. The question is, does physics support the idea that wind propulsion maintains the same capabilities as modern ships? I doubt physics today allows us to build a sailing ship that can maintain a steady 22 knots across the ocean unless it is a hybrid.

What ever happened to the ‚ÄúCalypso II‚Äù and its wind power system?,Neutral
"The reason most sailing yachts have one mast and usually two sails is not about reducing crew size. It is about getting the best windward efficiency. This is mainly necessary due to how sailboat races are conducted. They are very often upwind/downwind in nature. Upwind, the tall, two sail rig is champ.  Downwind, it is also champ, due to being able to fly a very large downwind sail.

When raid-style racing was introduced, two masted boats started appearing and doing well. This is because raid racing is often across the wind.

BTW, the smallest working four masterd schooner is a little more than 6m long and is being built by Sven Yrvind. Its mast are all cantilever and don't extend very far below the deck. Each sail has just a halyard and a sheet line. They will have reefing points as well. But sail area can quickly be reduced  by dropping one or more of the four sails. It looks complicated, but it is really quite simple.",Positive
"Your point about their theoretical mast design and the incredible forces they will be subjected to is a good one. I suspect they will have to heavily redesign the mechanism that joins the mast to the deck, and probably simplify it to get it to function in reality.",Positive
"The reason my sailboat and most small sailboats have two or three or four sails (Sloop, cutter, ketch) is not simplicity, it's being able to sail close to the wind. Old square riggers can't sail 'into the wind.' These primarily sloop rigged boats , like my 46' boat, can sail 35 degrees 'off the wind' and I do it all the time. This is called Close Hauled and it's also the only way the America's Cup boats sail. 
Sails on large ships, I think, is already a 'solved engineering problem.'  Sails are just wings, we know all about wings. They already know how to do it. The large model in the video is just proof of concept.  Yacht A, is a very large private sail yacht, everything about the sails is motor controlled. The sails roll out of the mast (as do mine). They're very efficient. What they are, compared to large container ships running on powerful engines, is slow.  
A 1000' (300m) container ship can do 25 knots, my boat does 7. What needs to be worked out is what cargos can  take 3 - 4 weeks to cross the Pacific and which cargos still need to get across in ten days? 
I've sailed Asia, across the Pacific and regularly off the California coast. Most large ships were only doing about 14 knots, and the ones I see on AIS in the past couple of years off California are doing 9 knots. 
Some of this is to lower pollution levels, save on increasingly expensive fuel. If speeds stay low like this, then sails on large ships could become competitive. 
I always think that when the aliens do visit Earth, all their technology will be far more advanced than ours. But, unless they have oceans and sailing on their planet, they are going to be amazed that we can cross oceans for free with sails. 

Storms. One of the reasons I became a sailor four years ago is weather prediction and communications have become so good, no one ever needs to sail in a  hurricane or typhoon. We regularly avoided the most intense parts of the storms that were near where we sailed.",Positive
Wind Assisted Propulsion = WAP,Neutral
"Other ships which don't need to be compatible with shore cranes are tankers and passenger ships. The self loading/unloading bulk freighters of the Great Lakes could be another opportunity for wind propulsion. There is at least one competing technology called DynaRig that has been around for decades and has been used/tested on a few large yachts. In addition to crew sizes, I think much of the focus on single masts comes from yacht racing - a single masted sloop rig maximized maneuverability and the ability to sail into the wind, which is important in yacht racing, but not so much for larger ships. As for 200m masts, there are already several large yachts in service or construction with masts approaching 100m, but these are mostly attempts to scale up single masted racing yachts. I suspect that multiple smaller masts would be more optimal for cargo ships.",Positive

Amazing how Martin Whitmarsh is all but a cameo in this,Positive
"Let's provide perspective.
1.5 tonnes of fuel per wing per day. So 3 tonnes of fuel per day.
Through a quick search I found that cargo ships use roughly anywhere from 150-300 tonnes of fuel per day. So we can call this 0.5-1% fuel savings.
Additionally, as of the time of posting I found fuel prices to cost anywhere from $600-715/tonne. That means that the wings are saving about $1800-2200/day. I don't have numbers for what these cost, but I found that grid-scale wind turbine blades (another suitably large wind energy-capturing mechanism) can cost at least $150k each. Let's put that together and estimate the cost of a 3-faced ""sail"" (call it for what it is, a high-tech sail) at at least $500k each, or over $1mil for both sails, though the real cost is likely much greater. With our fuel-savings cost estimate, this could pay back within 1.5-2 years, which if true would be pretty phenomenal savings. More realistically, if the sail costs were double or triple that then the fuel-savings breaks even after a much longer time frame, looking at 3-5 years or even longer. Unless companies are projecting for CO2e emissions costs I don't know if that is a viable payback for companies to install these beyond adding it to a few vessels for some good PR. I love this concept, but I don't see this being regularly adopted without the price of fuel shooting up dramatically or ports adding carbon taxes/levies to encourage CO2e reduction.",Positive

So innovative. Much more efficient than whichever method they used a couple hundred years ago.,Positive
Why something like this over an actual sail? No fabric that could handle the wind pressure at that size?,Positive
"Ok how much fuel are they saving, given the ships still need desiel generators to run their plants, their AMS, their AC, compressed air, anchors, electricity, potable water and also the sails? Secondly given the added tonnage of the sails will it be more cost effective (and environmentally friendly) to use the sails or go without them? Wish they published real numbers not promises. Need input from real marine engineering professionals, specifically chief engineers, 1st, 2nds and 3rd assistants. Then theres the safety factor because the weight and height of these things will change the ships center of gravity. So yeah... inclement weather. So maybe at best the ship would still burn 17 tons of fuel and at worse 297 tons of fuel a day based on the size of the vessel. Gosh why not just go nuclear.",Positive
"This is Ancient technology. It has been superseded by nearly 100 commercial ships using Flettner Rotors over the last 15 years.

"Let's make it simple! And face the green dreamers with reality. So most of the ships are in charter business...so this means owner of the vessel is just renting the ship for money to a guy who got the cargo and wants to transport it from point A to point B, and pays the fuel for this trip. So the owner of the ship wants the simplest possible ship, that does not need a lot of maintenance in order to maximise profit. This means a simple diesel engine. And these ""sails"" are only more stuff to maintain, which benefits ONLY the guy who takes the ship for rent but not the owner. Soooo...forget about....its all about money!!!",Positive

"They only fire up the massive diesel engines anytime there is rough weather or they need precise maneuvering or when the wind isn't blowing or when they are behind schedule or when the wind isn't blowing in the exact, correct, direction or when they need power on the ship or when they need to desalinate water or if they need to travel on a straighter course. Other than that, the boat travels along the hyper efficient zig zag path that any sailing vessel takes across the ocean, and that path also comes close to actually doubling the distance traveled.

At last some actual practical initiative instead of endless chatter abut the environment.,Neutral
"Wait till they get their first TRS.  I spent my entire working life at sea as an Engineer.  Those railings you see along the ship's side - called handrails - for obvious reasons - I have seen these stripped away from the deck , as well as pipework and heavy damage to other fixed structures - by heavy seas and hurricane force winds. Big structures like these sails when stowed will be easy meat for the wind.   Tropical Rotating Storms - aka TRS are common,  as are headwinds, when this technology is useless, so it still needs a large marine diesel engine. 

I would assume that if they have put in a lot of calcuation as to the benefits, then they would have also thought about the negative effects of having a large resistance of the stowed sails that in a head wind , would result in increased fuel consumption, or a reduction of speed that will eat into the shipowner's profits due to delayed delivery.  Nobody mentions that.

Saving 3 tonnes of fuel a day might seem impressive to a shore wallah,  but savings like these can be made by shaving a point of a knot off the voyage speed and by having an experienced Master who knows the winds and currents.  I find the guy's claim of saving tonnes of CO2 emissions per day a bit fantastic in the original meaning of the word, but I need to revisit my old Thermodynamics textbook to bone up on my stoichiometric calculations to be sure. I know from my own experience how to massage statistics to get the results I want. 

It is a great propaganda exercise though - the tree huggers will be ecstatic and will envision the entire marine fleet being retrofitted with planet saving fibreglass sails.  Lets see how long these sails last in service.",Positive

Sailing was part of the standard but is more restricted to the weather conditions. Can‚Äôt sail if there‚Äôs no wind, which happens. Take longer to sail if the wind isn‚Äôt going in your direction‚Ä¶ how shipping supposed to account for more days at sea considering spoilage? A 30 day trip is now 50? Eh, cool how much are those solid sails? $$$ tech is expensive, likely tax right off for the owner as his captain still uses the engines when the sailing system fails or is unusable.",Negative

My friend is a part of this initiative. So happy and proud of what their team has achieved. Way to go.,Positive
"The price for each sail seems to be unreleased to the enquiring public. No mention of it anywhere that I can find. Kept out of the picture then.
Were it say US$3 million each, such a cost to have 1 unit supplied & fitted, at currently a price of US$500 per ton of Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO).
We hear it would save an acclaimed 1.5 tons of HFO per day.
So a $750 saving per day for 1 sail.

This then when we work it out would take about 4,000 days to even break even. Around 11 years.
BUT, looking at it all, the ship would likely need a TECHNICIAN on board, or rather 2 on 12hr shifts to look after the sails, at least that amount, that wouldn't come cheap would it. 

Easily eating in to the $750, or rather if 2 sails utilised the $1500 per day saving.
THEN there would be the servicing costs of the sails with the longer term cost of replacement of the units. 
Corrosive effects of being seaborne and any subsequent damage, accidental or otherwise.

So all in all, no one aught to expect any financial savings, as there may be even a negative cost involved.
Rather as it is said there are savings in having less pollution. Or rather on PAPER there is.

Of cause there is a formula I have that is:  People = Pollution.

And we cannot get away from the fact that the use of international shipping with or without sails contribute towards an INCREASE of people. 
Therefore more pollution. 
ESPECIALLY there is more pollution if shipping the commodity of OIL, to be used as some form of fuel.
The use of shipping also contributing to the DEVELOPMENT of a Nation and therefore even MORE pollution.

So there may well be a widely acclaimed less CO2 and other toxic substances produced with these wind sails fitted specifically amongst the shipping community.
But long term, there would be even more SHIPPING in terms of number of vessel's and even more pollution caused by the production & use of the particular goods/fuel transported.

On the whole then, when logically looking at these matters I consider it to be a bit of an eco PR gimmick. 
An unsavoury and indeed an unpalatable conclusion it may well be all intere$ted partie$ & well wishers. But this is the truth of the matter that they cannot get away from, no matter their stated intent & public goodwill towards it all.

People = Pollution. 
All those really interested in having less pollution in the World should consider putting their efforts in to pressurising World Authorities in to rubbing out the Population increases they have already pencilled in, setting it lower.",Positive
