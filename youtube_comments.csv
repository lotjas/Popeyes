If they put up a one hundred meter by one hundred meter sail in a 120 mph wind, there would be about one billion watts of wind energy trying to get through the ten thousand square meters of the sail area.  If they turned off the engine and sailed downwind, at 30%efficiency, the propeller might generate 300 million watts of electricity.  That is about 1.5 kg of hydrogen per second at 75% efficienct electrolysis. . If they kept a constant heading slightly towards the eye of the hurricane, they would gradualky get closer to the eye wall where the winds are stronger.  The hurricane would carry them for thousands of miles.
If the hurricane lasted ten days, they would generate about a million kg of hydrogen which is the equivalent of about 50,000 barrels of oil or the equivalent of about 20 days ofuel for a container ship.  With the waves always behind them, they would surf down the huge waves instead of slamming the bow into them.  At $10/kg they might make more money just sailing around in hurricanes and tropical storms and selling hydrogen  than they do delivering cargo.
Something much smaller than a cargo ship might accomplish this.  Two parallel cylinders maybe ten meters in diameter and two hundred meters long arranged like a catamaran migh work. With big fins and wing like structures, the two cylinders that are slightly bouyant could slide under the waves down to about 10 meters below the surface with just streamlined, narrow support structures slicing through the 100 foot  waves with little resistance or disturbance from the waves.  
The right kind of prpelkers on the submerged cylinders might get 30% effuciency ior 300 million watts from the available wind energy.  In a season with 10 hurricanes that woukd add up to about a hundred million dollars.

How are you going to stack literally thousands of containers on ... 4 or more high above deck ... and have the sails be able to catch the wind? Sail would increase costs. The sailing vessel would need a considerably larger crew. Depending on the number of masts, the sailing ship could require a crew at least 10 ... 20 times larger than a diesel powered cargo ship, negating the ""fuel cost savings"".
Clipper ships were replaced by powered cargo ships because the latter were faster, could carry considerably more cargo, and required 1/4 or less crew than a comparable size clipper ship. Also, when the breezes stopped, so did the Clipper Ships. Remember the term ""BECALMED""?  Powered ships are immune to that.

Dream on. For a ship to be profitable it has to carry a certain amount of cargo. The ships get bigger because it costs less to run one ship that can carry 2000 containers than it does two smaller ships that can carry 1000 containers, or four even smaller ships that can only hold 500 containers.

Transporting liquids like fuel which can be pumped in and out of the tanks or carrying certain types of bulk goods, depending on their mode of loading and unloading could be done old-school.
There aren't many reasons other than economies of scale and crew wages relative to fuel cost as well as slightly less consistent transport times that would prevent the use of primarily sail-powered transport ships.
While steam engines started to be used in the mid 19th century, sailing transports remained viable well into the 20th century, with ""windjammers"" enjoying popularity up until WWII, so revisiting the windjammer for non-container transport wouldn't even be that far fetched.
Obviously a modern windjammer would require a more conventional auxiliary propulsion system, probably a combustion engine, but even this could be augmented. Say the prop shaft isn't driven directly by the backup engine but is a hybrid-electric system with an array of batteries forming part of the ships ballast.

MdI191-vNlc,@emmabird9745,0,2022-04-24T23:52:44Z,"Yes, wind propulsion is way over due.  It has been talked about for at least the last 30 years and not arrived yet so I won't hold my breath.
I hope the flettner rotor ship designers will consider dimples on their rotors.  Golf balls were originally smooth until it was discovered that caddies playing with old knocked about balls flew further.  Thus the dimpled ball was invented.  In the 1970s hexagon dimples were tried and found so sucessful that they were banned!
Wing sails have an advantage over flettner sails in that they do not need continuous power to rotate them (ok they need intermittent power to trim them).  Hopefully they will consider variable camber and slots/flaps for optimal efficientcy.
In either case the sails could incorporate solar cells to power them.
Another alternative, which is perhaps too obvious, is vertical wind turbines driving conventional screw propellers perhaps coupled to the existing shafts.  That is the only tech I can see which would allow the ship to sail directly into wind.
Another tech that may be worth looking at might be coander effect sails.  This would be a variation on the proven technology of the NOTAR helicopter tail booms.
The tea clippers you refer to were square rigged.  They operated most optimally with the wind from the aft quadrants.  They relied for their sucess on the highly detailed wind charts of prevailing strength and direction with time of year compiled in the 1840s.  Two things killed them off commercially, the labour intensive nature of their operation and the Suez canal, mainly the latter, which steam ships were better able to exploit.  The former (labour intensive) could be overcome with powered winches and computer control or some such.  Wind power for ships could be implemented in a modern version.
So called fore and aft rigged ships eg schooner rig sail best into or across the wind, but by that we mean at best about 45 deg (into) to the wind and best at 90 deg (for thrust).  They were incidentally effectively wing sails because they worked on the principle of the curved shape of the canvas forming an aerofoil lifting the ship forward.  Both the technologies you report here will have the same limitations.
A serious consideration for container ships or cruise liners is that to a side wind they are aerodynamic bricks which must suffer considerable leeway (drift down wind) which means the best direction for wing sails or Flettner rotors are worst for leeway.  At least bulk carriers can have a low freeboard so they will be better candidates for these solutions.
Yes the wind should be harnessed to improve their carbon footprint but whatever propulsors are fitted, to work the routes and so on will have to be optimised to the wind and perhaps multiple solutions shoud be used eg wing sails with vertical turbines driving screws.",yes wind propulsion is way over due it has been talked about for at least the last 30 years and not arrived yet so i won't hold my breath i hope the flettner rotor ship designers will consider dimples on their rotors golf balls were originally smooth until it was discovered that caddies playing with old knocked about balls flew further thus the dimpled ball was invented in the 1970s hexagon dimples were tried and found so sucessful that they were banned wing sails have an advantage over flettner sails in that they do not need continuous power to rotate them ok they need intermittent power to trim them hopefully they will consider variable camber and slots flaps for optimal efficientcy in either case the sails could incorporate solar cells to power them another alternative which is perhaps too obvious is vertical wind turbines driving conventional screw propellers perhaps coupled to the existing shafts that is the only tech i can see which would allow the ship to sail directly into wind another tech that may be worth looking at might be coander effect sails this would be a variation on the proven technology of the notar helicopter tail booms the tea clippers you refer to were square rigged they operated most optimally with the wind from the aft quadrants they relied for their sucess on the highly detailed wind charts of prevailing strength and direction with time of year compiled in the 1840s two things killed them off commercially the labour intensive nature of their operation and the suez canal mainly the latter which steam ships were better able to exploit the former labour intensive could be overcome with powered winches and computer control or some such wind power for ships could be implemented in a modern version so called fore and aft rigged ships eg schooner rig sail best into or across the wind but by that we mean at best about 45 deg into to the wind and best at 90 deg for thrust they were incidentally effectively wing sails because they worked on the principle of the curved shape of the canvas forming an aerofoil lifting the ship forward both the technologies you report here will have the same limitations a serious consideration for container ships or cruise liners is that to a side wind they are aerodynamic bricks which must suffer considerable leeway drift down wind which means the best direction for wing sails or flettner rotors are worst for leeway at least bulk carriers can have a low freeboard so they will be better candidates for these solutions yes the wind should be harnessed to improve their carbon footprint but whatever propulsors are fitted to work the routes and so on will have to be optimised to the wind and perhaps multiple solutions shoud be used eg wing sails with vertical turbines driving screws,0.9872,Positive,wind|sails|wing|power|ships|best,operational,wind|ship|port

I am a Naval Architect working in the shipping industry and specifically working on wind assisted propulsion. I would just like to point out a little inaccuracy, the diagram you show at https://youtu.be/MdI191-vNlc?t=443 is slightly incorrect. The Drag as you mention is not necessarily in the opposite direction of movement (if it is, the sail is probably not positioned correctly), what is certain though is that it will always be in the same direction of the apparent wind (which can be in any direction). Therefore, the Thrust (or what we call the forwards direction force) will always be a combination of lift and drag depending on the direction of the apparent wind. For example when running downwind, the sail will be positioned so that it only provides Drag (in the same direction of the apparent wind therefore pushing the ships forwards).

What you may have wanted to refer to was the resistance force that the ship needs to overcome in order to move forward, this is always in the opposite direction of movement. There is a dedicated wikipedia page explaining how all of those forces interact with each other and I think is it fascinating for anyone interested in sailing: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forces_on_sails

Further, as someone commentated below the ships also need power when they are idle or manoeuvring and here clean fuels like amonia and hydrogen can be a solution for  all types for ships.",great video but as a mariner i think many of you forget that different ships has different trade so they will have different requirements for power and propulsion for instance while wind can probably work well on deep sea trading i e the large tankers bulkers etc that trades between continents it will not work for vessels that are for instance serving the offshore installations like wind etc and other costal short sea trade therefore i don't think it is one solutions that will fit all but rather a combination further as someone commentated below the ships also need power when they are idle or manoeuvring and here clean fuels like amonia and hydrogen can be a solution for all types for ships,0.9645,Positive,different|ships|think|trade|power|instance,economic,wind|ship|cost

MdI191-vNlc,@jackb8097,2,2021-12-08T19:08:57Z,"Hi Matt, I really like your videos & because ships are my business (I'm a marine engineer with 40-years in the industry: 10+ years sailing on ships and the rest operating, repairing, modifying and surveying them) I thought I'd chip in with a few thoughts on this one.
I've always taken a great deal of interest in anything to do with energy-saving or operational efficiency on ships and I'm always keen to evaluate new ideas and equipment and give them a fair but practical shake.  
Some of the data you quoted for the bulk carrier fitted with 4 moveable rotors didn't seem to add up, although I appreciate that the manufacturer probably provided you this data so this is no criticism of you, however; 
78 tons of fuel saved over a period of 518 sailing days, or a 12.5% fuel saving suggests a fuel consumption without the rotors of 624 tons, which is a daily consumption of 1.2 tons/day. This is the daily consumption of the ship's diesel generators, supplying electrical power, not the main engine.
The typical loaded speed range for a ship of this size/type is 12-15 knots with a fuel consumption of 28-35 tons/day depending on vessel speed. Over 518 sailing days the expected fuel consumption would be between 14,504 and 18,130 tons of fuel. 
Even if the rotors saved 78 tons of fuel, this represents only 0.4-0.5% of the expected consumption.
The less than 2-hours to install a rotor also makes me very skeptical too, but the fuel saving figures were a big enough red flag, so I left it there. 
New ideas and equipment are often interesting, with many having practical potential however, it's sometimes difficult not to be cynical about the businesses who are marketing these ideas. 
Thankfully I'm a glass-half-full guy most of the time so I'm not a cynic yet!  
Interesting video nonetheless, thanks for sharing.

Best regards,

Storing it requires that it be kept pressurized or at cryo temps. Its both toxic to people in moderate concentrations, and highly toxic to marine life and ecosystems in low concentrations. While Anhydrous ammonia gas is lighter than air, when combined with humidity it becomes heavier than air. This is due to it being hygroscopic and readily mixes with water. 
A leak while a ship is in port could be disastrous not just for anyone working or living nearby due to a toxic cloud, but also to the marine environment.

Flettner rotors, if there were hard data to support those claims, or ""estimates"" installing flettner rotors would be the most busy business in the world right now.      

The problem with synthetic fuels is that they're very cheap to produce from fossil fuels, and very expensive to produce from electricity. They might become viable if we reach the point where we have almost constant excess of renewable power. You can't base a fuel industry on periods of hours, rarely days, when electric power is cheap.

I think the shipping industry needs to completely redesign the ships, and system. Autonomous multihull ships, carrying very little cargo each, compared to the largest ships in use today, and smaller, but still large enough to fit  l lot of sails, that is also covered in solar cells. And batteries enough to keep at least a decent speed for many hours without sunlight and favourable wind. High initial cost, but negligible operating costs.   

Also, the Bernoulli effect contributes very little to airfoil lift, the main reason wings are designed as they are is to minimise drag. The fact that the Bernoulli effect isn't what keeps planes in the air is proved by the fact that airplanes can fly upside down.  Also, most of the material you used of ""wing sails"" had sails that were symmetrical. Wing shaped sails doesn't solve the reason why sails were replaced by engines, which is in the wind itself, the unreliability of it.

MdI191-vNlc,@cryptickcryptick2241,0,2021-11-24T13:50:31Z,"Currently, ships burn unrefined crude oil while out at sea, (this is very dirty) and when they approach land switch over to a cleaner  diesel fuel blend which is much more expensive. With this knowledge it may be easier to simple retrofit ships with scrubber technology to clean up the bad emissions. It has taken years, but the US has installed catalytic converters on cars which got rid on 99% of the real bad emissions. When sailing in international waters, ships are free of laws from all countries so regulating the ships is going to be complicated, this may take a lot of international agreement. We have the technology now to run those ships cleaner, whether we should or not, and the cost benefit of all the implications is complicated.

MdI191-vNlc,@BernardLS,157,2021-11-24T12:12:34Z,"In 1870 a premium sailing vessel entered service, the ‘Cutty Sark’.  The ‘Cutty Sark’ was 64.74 metres in length with a beam of 10.97 metres and a loaded displacement of 2 100 tonnes.  She was able to carry, at best, 1 700 tonnes of cargo and to harness the energy in the wind the available spread of canvas was up to 2 976m2 which was tended by a crew of about 30 skilled men.  The ratio between the sail area (SA) and the vessels displacement (D) determines how lively she was; ‘lively’ being nautical speak for ‘fast and manoeuvrable’.  The carrying capacity of cargo ships is constrained in two ways, mass and volume which leads us to the ‘stowage factor’ of the cargo; the more mass on board the greater the displacement which in turn impacts the efficiency of the hull form and the sail area / displacement ratio.  A vessel constrained by mass is said to be ‘down but not full’, while a vessel constrained by volume is said to be ‘full but not down.  When in the tea trade, which the ‘Cutty Sark’ was designed and built for with fine lines (more nautical tech speak, so again no need to worry about it) she could carry around 600 tonnes of cargo at speeds of up to 17.5 knots dependent on the prevailing wind and had a typical China to UK time on passage of 120 days.  The tea trade was very competitive so ‘time on passage’ was a large factor in securing the premium freight rate that made the ‘Cutty Sark’ cost effective.  Rounding things out, her maximum available sail area gave circa 5m2 of canvas for every tonne of tea carried.  As soon as the Suez Canal opened, which the ‘Cutty Sark’ was unable to sail through; she lost her advantage, raw speed, to the steam powered ships of that era who could beat her ‘time on passage’ by taking that short cut.  Mechanically powered ships have improved in terms of efficiency, on a freight tonne mile basis, by at least one order of magnitude since then.  After losing out to the coal burning, fire tube boiler, steam reciprocating mechanical ships of the late 19th century ‘Cutty Sark’ was relegated to the Australian wool trade, just about the bottom of the barrel in maritime terms and only one small step up from being a 'honey barge'.",in 1870 a premium sailing vessel entered service the cutty sark the cutty sark was 64 74 metres in length with a beam of 10 97 metres and a loaded displacement of 2 100 tonnes she was able to carry at best 1 700 tonnes of cargo and to harness the energy in the wind the available spread of canvas was up to 2 976m2 which was tended by a crew of about 30 skilled men the ratio between the sail area sa and the vessels displacement d determines how lively she was lively being nautical speak for fast and manoeuvrable the carrying capacity of cargo ships is constrained in two ways mass and volume which leads us to the stowage factor of the cargo the more mass on board the greater the displacement which in turn impacts the efficiency of the hull form and the sail area displacement ratio a vessel constrained by mass is said to be down but not full while a vessel constrained by volume is said to be full but not down when in the tea trade which the cutty sark was designed and built for with fine lines more nautical tech speak so again no need to worry about it she could carry around 600 tonnes of cargo at speeds of up to 17 5 knots dependent on the prevailing wind and had a typical china to uk time on passage of 120 days the tea trade was very competitive so time on passage was a large factor in securing the premium freight rate that made the cutty sark cost effective rounding things out her maximum available sail area gave circa 5m2 of canvas for every tonne of tea carried as soon as the suez canal opened which the cutty sark was unable to sail through she lost her advantage raw speed to the steam powered ships of that era who could beat her time on passage by taking that short cut mechanically powered ships have improved in terms of efficiency on a freight tonne mile basis by at least one order of magnitude since then after losing out to the coal burning fire tube boiler steam reciprocating mechanical ships of the late 19th century cutty sark was relegated to the australian wool trade just about the bottom of the barrel in maritime terms and only one small step up from being a 'honey barge',0.8431,Positive,cutty|sark|cutty sark|displacement|cargo|sail,economic|operational,wind|ship|cost

Kits extract wind energy @100-150m above a ship and are guided around a figure of eight that pulls the vessel forwards. I assume that for open water this is the most optimal. In narrow areas like docks and waterways on uses an all electric battery and electric more setup. During open water sailing the battery pack can be used to power all the electrical systems and safety systems as well.

MdI191-vNlc,@UniversalAdjuster,0,2021-11-23T21:18:58Z,"To assert that wind powered ships are faster is somewhat disingenuous.  Sailing ship water speed is highly dependent on the point of sail, broad reaching being usually the fastest.  However, the wind does not blow at a constant speed or direction which in combination with water currents greatly affects how long and what it costs to move from port to port.  In addition many ships need to move through waterways such as the Suez and Panama canals.

Are they still around?  Anything that has the potential to lower the shipping companies bottom line has a good chance of seeing good adoption. Cargo ships have pretty much all adopted slow steaming to reduce their fuel costs by moving slower. For this reason I'm skeptical of the biofuels avenue. Ships run on the cheapest dirtiest sludge to remain cost-competitive. It's doubtful any form of synthetic fuel would get competitive with bottom-of-the-barrel sludge.

I have another belief of how to explain airplane lift.
As the wing pass through the air it will be:
1 forced by underside of the wing to move down (positive air pressure) and the wing will capture and opposite reaction upwards, witch we call lift.
2 flowing over the wing. The ""Coanda"" effect makes the air keep following the curved surface covering the top of the wing downwards action - and create (negative air pressure) an opposite reaction upwards = more lift.

The Coanda effect can easy be demonstrated by holding a round object for ex a bottle tilted on the side under water tap and see how the water follow the curved surface and may leave the bottle at an angle opposite side from where the water hit the bottle.",wind is vastly untapped recourse on ships i hope they continue and expands testing both rotor design and wing design applications i have another belief of how to explain airplane lift as the wing pass through the air it will be 1 forced by underside of the wing to move down positive air pressure and the wing will capture and opposite reaction upwards witch we call lift 2 flowing over the wing the coanda effect makes the air keep following the curved surface covering the top of the wing downwards action - and create negative air pressure an opposite reaction upwards more lift the coanda effect can easy be demonstrated by holding a round object for ex a bottle tilted on the side under water tap and see how the water follow the curved surface and may leave the bottle at an angle opposite side from where the water hit the bottle,-0.0258,Neutral,wing|air|lift|opposite|bottle|water,,wind|ship

MdI191-vNlc,@SteinVarjord,4,2021-11-23T14:06:38Z,"There’s no doubt that a cargo ship from the future will need to use wind power. Anything else is flat out incompetent. Of course they will also need some other power, but taking more than 80% of propulsive power from the wind is easily achievable without any new knowledge whatsoever. The rotating “wing” is a dead end. The efficiency is stupid low. The only reason they are not rejected is that engineers feel better about things that look like machines and have a seemingly cool way of working. 

It’s quite easy to make a mainly sailing cargo vessel that can move fast and have reliable passage times. It needs to have an actual boat designer look at the shapes and functionality. Present cargo ships are designed predominantly as industrial units, where total efficiency is disregarded. If a cargo plane was designed with the same mindset, it could never fly. 

The hull and superstructure needs to be streamlined, have little windage. Cargo must be inside the ship, not stacked on top of it. The under water parts must be better than just cargo boxes. They need to be seen as actual vessels. Probably foldable leeboards are needed, as a dramatically more efficient way of limiting leeway. Also an easy solution, that has been in use on sailing cargo ships in northern Europe for 600 years. Soft wing rigs or rigid ones that can be lowered is the right setup for propulsion. Airplanes use wings, because that’s the only usable option. The task on a ship is exactly the same one. 

The cargo ships of today are so poorly configured because there was no motivation for not being extremely wasteful. Now there is. If shipping is presented with the true bill for their wastefulness, they will clean up in the blink of an eye. As mentioned, all necessary knowledge has been available for decades, much of it even for centuries.

Instead, mass produce semi-submersible, ocean circulating catamaran tugs with huge wing sail arrays on both hulls. The point would be to tow any ship by using maximum sail power wherever possible to reduce bunker fuel consumption by 60-80 percent ASAP.  Replacing legacy Panamax and Maersk size ships with sailing versions is simply impractical enough to be impossible and a huge distraction from solving the problem immediately. Economics are simple: the value of saved fuel pays for the sailing tugs and towing service. Theoretically, existing cargo ships will continue to operate up to existing life expectancies without impacting schedules or port activity.

Semi-submersible catamaran hulls will be more stable, efficient and capable of delivering more wind power than dicey retrofit sail kits, as well as more robust for weathering storms. Mounting arrays of large wing sails on two hulls allows for significant structural cross-bracing. Huge tow lines can be floated on retractable, inflatable tubes to connect tug to cargo ship at standardized attachment points at strong points near the waterline on bows. The sail tugs would rotate crews offshore and remain at sea towing customer ships like barges more-or-less continuously.

L86znpiEzX0,@BernardLS,0,2020-12-30T07:17:29Z,"To address the suggestions that sail power is the answer I offer the following example.  In 1870 a premium sailing vessel entered service, the ‘Cutty Sark’.  The Cutty Sark was 64.74 metres in length with a beam of 10.97 metres and a loaded displacement of 2 100 tonnes.  She was able to carry 1 700 tonnes of cargo and to harness the energy in the wind the available spread of canvas was up to 2 976m2 which was tended by a crew of about 30 skilled men.  A ratio between the sail area (SA) and the vessels displacement (D) determines how lively she is; ‘lively’ being nautical speak for ‘fast and manoeuvrable’.  The carrying capacity of cargo ships is constrained in two ways, mass and volume which leads us to the ‘stowage factor’ of the cargo; the more mass on board the greater the displacement which in turn impacts the efficiency of the hull form and sail area / displacement ratio.  A vessel constrained by mass is said to be ‘down but not full’, a vessel constrained by volume ‘full but not down.  When in the tea trade, which the ‘Cutty Sark’ was designed and built for with fine lines (more nautical tech speak so again - no need to worry about it) she could carry around 600 tonnes of cargo at speeds of up to 17.5 knots dependent on the prevailing wind and had a typical China to UK time on passage of 120 days.  The tea trade was very competitive so ‘time on passage’ was a large factor in securing the premium freight rate that made her cost effective.  Rounding things out her maximum available sail area gave circa 5m2 of canvas for every tonne of tea carried.

As soon as the Suez Canal opened, which the ‘Cutty Sark’ was unable to sail through; she lost her advantage, raw speed, to the steam powered ships of that era who could beat her ‘time on passage’.  Mechanically powered ships have improved in terms of efficiency, on a freight tonne mile basis, by at least one order of magnitude since then.  After losing out to the coal burning, steam reciprocating mechanical ships of the late 19th century ‘Cutty Sark’ was relegated to the Australian wool trade, just about the bottom of the barrel in maritime terms and only one small step up from being a 'honey barge'.  The canvas, cordage and extra manpower needed for sailing ships was never a very benign environmental option so please discount any idea of sail as ‘sustainable’.  All this is without the problem that if ‘the wind don’t blow the ship don’t go’, when it does blow it often blows in the wrong direction for your cargo delivery needs and sometimes there is rather too much of it for comfort.

Random facts about ‘Cutty Sark’, it is said to have been possible to coax 3 000 horse power out of her sails, or in ‘real money’ 2 206 500 Watts (2.2 megaWatts), in those elusive ideal conditions or 741 Watts for each square meter of sail area.  So that majestic spread of canvas would have been even less efficacious for delivering your baubles and bows from the orient, despite taking about 120 days on the voyage.",to address the suggestions that sail power is the answer i offer the following example in 1870 a premium sailing vessel entered service the cutty sark the cutty sark was 64 74 metres in length with a beam of 10 97 metres and a loaded displacement of 2 100 tonnes she was able to carry 1 700 tonnes of cargo and to harness the energy in the wind the available spread of canvas was up to 2 976m2 which was tended by a crew of about 30 skilled men a ratio between the sail area sa and the vessels displacement d determines how lively she is lively being nautical speak for fast and manoeuvrable the carrying capacity of cargo ships is constrained in two ways mass and volume which leads us to the stowage factor of the cargo the more mass on board the greater the displacement which in turn impacts the efficiency of the hull form and sail area displacement ratio a vessel constrained by mass is said to be down but not full a vessel constrained by volume full but not down when in the tea trade which the cutty sark was designed and built for with fine lines more nautical tech speak so again - no need to worry about it she could carry around 600 tonnes of cargo at speeds of up to 17 5 knots dependent on the prevailing wind and had a typical china to uk time on passage of 120 days the tea trade was very competitive so time on passage was a large factor in securing the premium freight rate that made her cost effective rounding things out her maximum available sail area gave circa 5m2 of canvas for every tonne of tea carried as soon as the suez canal opened which the cutty sark was unable to sail through she lost her advantage raw speed to the steam powered ships of that era who could beat her time on passage mechanically powered ships have improved in terms of efficiency on a freight tonne mile basis by at least one order of magnitude since then after losing out to the coal burning steam reciprocating mechanical ships of the late 19th century cutty sark was relegated to the australian wool trade just about the bottom of the barrel in maritime terms and only one small step up from being a 'honey barge' the canvas cordage and extra manpower needed for sailing ships was never a very benign environmental option so please discount any idea of sail as sustainable all this is without the problem that if the wind don t blow the ship don t go when it does blow it often blows in the wrong direction for your cargo delivery needs and sometimes there is rather too much of it for comfort random facts about cutty sark it is said to have been possible to coax 3 000 horse power out of her sails or in real money 2 206 500 watts 2 2 megawatts in those elusive ideal conditions or 741 watts for each square meter of sail area so that majestic spread of canvas would have been even less efficacious for delivering your baubles and bows from the orient despite taking about 120 days on the voyage,0.9639,Positive,sail|cutty|sark|cutty sark|cargo|ships,economic|operational,wind|ship|cost

Surprised you didn't include it as the longest running project next to Skysail. A Flettner has a Ca lift coefficient of 34 vs a wing having a Ca of 4. Control systems for a single force by angle of attack is fairly common today. The Flettner generates way more lift to save fuel and is easier to shut down in storm by shutting off it's rotaion. Stuck or mangled telescopic wings are a SOLAS safety concern to people. A wing is still an active wing always directing it's resulting force somewhere. 

If you ship a reefer container (huge 40t fridge) full of nitrogen atmosphere stored Avocado, it's all a messy rotten waste arriving just 2 days late. Insurance pays or doesn't pay out 40 M USD in damages htting no wind conditions. So full sail isn't the main idea, IMO  MARPOL regulations and saving fuel is. Wallenius is doing RoRo of cars. High value goods where overall CO2 lifecycle fleet emissions regimes apply to consumer product. Car makes are fined for missing fleet emission targets. So the ocean Bird busness model is a bit skewed in favour of this. A RoRo doesn't use container bridges in congested urban port areas, where landuse is already maxed out for efficiency, automation and flexibility.

Most ship owners plan for Bio or eFuels to blend in and gradually replace bunker oil. Aerofoil sails It's certainly a topic awaited to mature in special purpose newbuilds first rather than retrofits.
Overcapacty has plagued shipping makets for 2 decades of crisis now. people are vary on experiments unless they are backed by gov R&D funds. Industry people basically pray for older less efficients ships being forcibly retired by CO2 regimes. Pension funds invested in these ships don't. Ship design is one of the slowest moving industries in adopting new tech. A ship cost millions and losing one to accident is still common and ocean waters are rough on wearing out any tech. Plus lifes of crew are at stake next to massive losse sof cargo and mad customers impacted by spare parts, medicals, fertilizers, food or key electric components not arriving on schedule.

A smaller ferry operator has more freedom and better funding to experiment. But these people aren't excatly flush in funds either.
Actually such tech risks turned from increasing the funding risk to decreasing it by making the future profitablitiy outlook under C02 emission outlook more favorable to banks and funds.
That's a huge boost to these add on fuel saving systems. It all starts with selling the idea to the bank or fund behind the newbuild.

Our take is eFuels from tidal power simply replace the diesel. That pays off when you factor in where you create renewables and need to use them and how cheap they can be this way.

L86znpiEzX0,@BernardLS,0,2020-12-02T17:04:05Z,"To address the suggestions that sail power is the answer I offer the following.  In 1870 a premium sailing vessel entered service, the ‘Cutty Sark’, she could carry around 600 tonnes of cargo at speeds of up to 17.5 knots, dependent on the prevailing wind, to harness the energy the available spread of canvas was up to 2 976m2.  To round things out that was circa 5m2 of canvas for every tonne of cargo carried.  The ‘Cutty Sark’ was designed and built for employment in the tea trade where speed was a large factor in securing the premium freight rate but as soon as the Suez Canal opened, which the ‘Cutty Sark’ was unable to sail through, she lost her advantage to the steam powered ships of that time.  Mechanically powered ships have improved in terms of efficiency, on a freight tonne mile basis, by at least one order of magnitude since then.  After losing out to the coal burning, steam reciprocating mechanical ships of the late 19th century ‘Cutty Sark’ was relegated to the Australian wool trade, just about the bottom of the barrel in maritime terms and only one small step up from being a 'honey barge'.  The canvas, cordage and extra manpower needed for sailing ships was never a zero cost option so please discount any idea of sail as ‘sustainable’ in environmental terms.  All this is without the problem that if ‘the wind don’t blow the ship don’t go’, when it does blow it often blows in the wrong direction for your cargo delivery needs and sometimes there is rather too much of it for comfort.",to address the suggestions that sail power is the answer i offer the following in 1870 a premium sailing vessel entered service the cutty sark she could carry around 600 tonnes of cargo at speeds of up to 17 5 knots dependent on the prevailing wind to harness the energy the available spread of canvas was up to 2 976m2 to round things out that was circa 5m2 of canvas for every tonne of cargo carried the cutty sark was designed and built for employment in the tea trade where speed was a large factor in securing the premium freight rate but as soon as the suez canal opened which the cutty sark was unable to sail through she lost her advantage to the steam powered ships of that time mechanically powered ships have improved in terms of efficiency on a freight tonne mile basis by at least one order of magnitude since then after losing out to the coal burning steam reciprocating mechanical ships of the late 19th century cutty sark was relegated to the australian wool trade just about the bottom of the barrel in maritime terms and only one small step up from being a 'honey barge' the canvas cordage and extra manpower needed for sailing ships was never a zero cost option so please discount any idea of sail as sustainable in environmental terms all this is without the problem that if the wind don t blow the ship don t go when it does blow it often blows in the wrong direction for your cargo delivery needs and sometimes there is rather too much of it for comfort,0.8939,Positive,cutty|sark|ships|cutty sark|sail|cargo,economic,wind|ship|cost

It is not far-fetched that based on these principals that conceptually, a solution with a large collective area of aerofoils would outperform the other two solutions maybe even by a large amount.

L86znpiEzX0,@Urgelt,0,2020-11-06T04:55:25Z,"Wind-powered ships either means slow ships, or hybrids of some sort.  Speaking generally, wind-power also eats into cargo space on a ship.  Kites are an exception; not much cargo space is used.  But the tech isn't mature.

Slow ships mean more product is locked up in transportation.  The 'pipeline' is longer.  Not advantageous.  I don't expect that many ships will ever be constructed which rely solely on wind power for cargo transportation.

What sort of hybrids could we talking about?  As batteries improve, electric propulsion for ships will expand.  Japan is already building a small fleet of electric ships for coastal shipping.  They can't go the distance on long international routes, but coastal shipping is not insignificant.  And as part of hybrid propulsion systems, batteries will probably play an increasing role.  With added sails, a kite, and hydrogen fuel cells, a ship should be able to attain reasonable speeds without emissions, while the batteries and fuel cells will prevent a hybrid ship from being stalled for lack of wind.

Hydrogen isn't an efficient way to store and use energy, and it won't rival fuel oil for cost, but it's still an option for a hybrid, as not all of the energy required to drive a hybrid will be expensive once the initial capital investment is made.  Wind energy will be free to harvest, and grid electricity is cheaper even than fuel oil.

Today's cargo ships have terrible aerodynamics.  They're basically blocks mounted on a hull.  So when we speak of reducing emissions, aerodynamics is a dimension to consider.  We can cut down emissions simply by streamlining cargo ships, in principle.  Some new concepts for stowage may need to be developed.  Containers simply aren't aerodynamic.

Another dimension is the immense need globalization imposes on our civilization for shipping.  This is temporary - a phase we are going through.  Tech advances will likely reduce the need, and the economic justification, for centralized production.  For an example of how a company can plan to reduce reliance on shipping, look no further than the auto industry, which often sites factories to serve geographical locations.  Looking further ahead, tech such as 3-D printing may advance to the point where many things communities need can be easily produced in low volumes locally.  Advances in robotics, AI and 3-D printing may ultimately lead us - in the long term - to microfactories which can flexibly make many things, not just one thing, and do so economically at local scales.  We may need fewer ships in future decades as these trends play out.


We'll still need to move raw materials around, of course.  And food, probably, though there is potential for vertical farms serving communities which lack sufficient farmland to produce what they need.

There is, as you pointed out, an obstacle to overcome.  Ship owners don't pay for fuel for cargo shipments, so they have no incentive to reduce fuel expenditures.  But this is easily resolved by government action.  It just needs legislation and incentives.

I think the only certainty here is that we must, and will, begin to reduce emissions from cargo shipping.  Exactly how that will play out isn't easy to predict.  There are a lot of moving parts, and technologies still remain to be developed.  Falling battery prices and maturing tech alternatives will play a role.",wind-powered ships either means slow ships or hybrids of some sort speaking generally wind-power also eats into cargo space on a ship kites are an exception not much cargo space is used but the tech isn't mature slow ships mean more product is locked up in transportation the 'pipeline' is longer not advantageous i don't expect that many ships will ever be constructed which rely solely on wind power for cargo transportation what sort of hybrids could we talking about as batteries improve electric propulsion for ships will expand japan is already building a small fleet of electric ships for coastal shipping they can't go the distance on long international routes but coastal shipping is not insignificant and as part of hybrid propulsion systems batteries will probably play an increasing role with added sails a kite and hydrogen fuel cells a ship should be able to attain reasonable speeds without emissions while the batteries and fuel cells will prevent a hybrid ship from being stalled for lack of wind hydrogen isn't an efficient way to store and use energy and it won't rival fuel oil for cost but it's still an option for a hybrid as not all of the energy required to drive a hybrid will be expensive once the initial capital investment is made wind energy will be free to harvest and grid electricity is cheaper even than fuel oil today's cargo ships have terrible aerodynamics they're basically blocks mounted on a hull so when we speak of reducing emissions aerodynamics is a dimension to consider we can cut down emissions simply by streamlining cargo ships in principle some new concepts for stowage may need to be developed containers simply aren't aerodynamic another dimension is the immense need globalization imposes on our civilization for shipping this is temporary - a phase we are going through tech advances will likely reduce the need and the economic justification for centralized production for an example of how a company can plan to reduce reliance on shipping look no further than the auto industry which often sites factories to serve geographical locations looking further ahead tech such as 3-d printing may advance to the point where many things communities need can be easily produced in low volumes locally advances in robotics ai and 3-d printing may ultimately lead us - in the long term - to microfactories which can flexibly make many things not just one thing and do so economically at local scales we may need fewer ships in future decades as these trends play out we'll still need to move raw materials around of course and food probably though there is potential for vertical farms serving communities which lack sufficient farmland to produce what they need there is as you pointed out an obstacle to overcome ship owners don't pay for fuel for cargo shipments so they have no incentive to reduce fuel expenditures but this is easily resolved by government action it just needs legislation and incentives i think the only certainty here is that we must and will begin to reduce emissions from cargo shipping exactly how that will play out isn't easy to predict there are a lot of moving parts and technologies still remain to be developed falling battery prices and maturing tech alternatives will play a role,0.9123,Positive,ships|cargo|need|fuel|wind|shipping,economic,wind|ship|transport|cost|port

Rotating cylinders are the most inefficient sails known to man.
And regards sails, look at the sail area of a tea-clipper in comparison to those fixed sails - they would only give you 1 knot of propulsion.
A full set of sails on a cargo ship would probably save 2% of fuel used, and cost a small fortune to fit.

When raid-style racing was introduced, two masted boats started appearing and doing well. This is because raid racing is often across the wind.

Old square riggers can't sail 'into the wind.' These primarily sloop rigged boats , like my 46' boat, can sail 35 degrees 'off the wind' and I do it all the time. This is called Close Hauled and it's also the only way the America's Cup boats sail. 
Sails on large ships, I think, is already a 'solved engineering problem.'  Sails are just wings, we know all about wings. They already know how to do it. The large model in the video is just proof of concept.  Yacht A, is a very large private sail yacht, everything about the sails is motor controlled. The sails roll out of the mast (as do mine). They're very efficient. What they are, compared to large container ships running on powerful engines, is slow.  
A 1000' (300m) container ship can do 25 knots, my boat does 7. What needs to be worked out is what cargos can  take 3 - 4 weeks to cross the Pacific and which cargos still need to get across in ten days? 
I've sailed Asia, across the Pacific and regularly off the California coast. Most large ships were only doing about 14 knots, and the ones I see on AIS in the past couple of years off California are doing 9 knots. 
Some of this is to lower pollution levels, save on increasingly expensive fuel. If speeds stay low like this, then sails on large ships could become competitive. 
I always think that when the aliens do visit Earth, all their technology will be far more advanced than ours. But, unless they have oceans and sailing on their planet, they are going to be amazed that we can cross oceans for free with sails.

KNZlQXBvQCk,@nickpiovesan4361,1,2023-10-16T11:58:42Z,"Let's provide perspective.
1.5 tonnes of fuel per wing per day. So 3 tonnes of fuel per day.
Through a quick search I found that cargo ships use roughly anywhere from 150-300 tonnes of fuel per day. So we can call this 0.5-1% fuel savings.
Additionally, as of the time of posting I found fuel prices to cost anywhere from $600-715/tonne. That means that the wings are saving about $1800-2200/day. I don't have numbers for what these cost, but I found that grid-scale wind turbine blades (another suitably large wind energy-capturing mechanism) can cost at least $150k each. Let's put that together and estimate the cost of a 3-faced ""sail"" (call it for what it is, a high-tech sail) at at least $500k each, or over $1mil for both sails, though the real cost is likely much greater. With our fuel-savings cost estimate, this could pay back within 1.5-2 years, which if true would be pretty phenomenal savings. More realistically, if the sail costs were double or triple that then the fuel-savings breaks even after a much longer time frame, looking at 3-5 years or even longer. Unless companies are projecting for CO2e emissions costs I don't know if that is a viable payback for companies to install these beyond adding it to a few vessels for some good PR. I love this concept, but I don't see this being regularly adopted without the price of fuel shooting up dramatically or ports adding carbon taxes/levies to encourage CO2e reduction.",let's provide perspective 1 5 tonnes of fuel per wing per day so 3 tonnes of fuel per day through a quick search i found that cargo ships use roughly anywhere from 150-300 tonnes of fuel per day so we can call this 0 5-1 fuel savings additionally as of the time of posting i found fuel prices to cost anywhere from 600-715 tonne that means that the wings are saving about 1800-2200 day i don't have numbers for what these cost but i found that grid-scale wind turbine blades another suitably large wind energy-capturing mechanism can cost at least 150k each let's put that together and estimate the cost of a 3-faced sail call it for what it is a high-tech sail at at least 500k each or over 1mil for both sails though the real cost is likely much greater with our fuel-savings cost estimate this could pay back within 1 5-2 years which if true would be pretty phenomenal savings more realistically if the sail costs were double or triple that then the fuel-savings breaks even after a much longer time frame looking at 3-5 years or even longer unless companies are projecting for co2e emissions costs i don't know if that is a viable payback for companies to install these beyond adding it to a few vessels for some good pr i love this concept but i don't see this being regularly adopted without the price of fuel shooting up dramatically or ports adding carbon taxes levies to encourage co2e reduction,0.9793,Positive,fuel|cost|per|day|savings|tonnes,economic,wind|ship|cost|port

Those railings you see along the ship's side - called handrails - for obvious reasons - I have seen these stripped away from the deck , as well as pipework and heavy damage to other fixed structures - by heavy seas and hurricane force winds. Big structures like these sails when stowed will be easy meat for the wind.   Tropical Rotating Storms - aka TRS are common,  as are headwinds, when this technology is useless, so it still needs a large marine diesel engine. 

I would assume that if they have put in a lot of calcuation as to the benefits, then they would have also thought about the negative effects of having a large resistance of the stowed sails that in a head wind , would result in increased fuel consumption, or a reduction of speed that will eat into the shipowner's profits due to delayed delivery.  Nobody mentions that.

Saving 3 tonnes of fuel a day might seem impressive to a shore wallah,  but savings like these can be made by shaving a point of a knot off the voyage speed and by having an experienced Master who knows the winds and currents.  I find the guy's claim of saving tonnes of CO2 emissions per day a bit fantastic in the original meaning of the word, but I need to revisit my old Thermodynamics textbook to bone up on my stoichiometric calculations to be sure.

Were it say US$3 million each, such a cost to have 1 unit supplied & fitted, at currently a price of US$500 per ton of Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO).
We hear it would save an acclaimed 1.5 tons of HFO per day.
So a $750 saving per day for 1 sail.

This then when we work it out would take about 4,000 days to even break even. Around 11 years.
BUT, looking at it all, the ship would likely need a TECHNICIAN on board, or rather 2 on 12hr shifts to look after the sails, at least that amount, that wouldn't come cheap would it. 

Easily eating in to the $750, or rather if 2 sails utilised the $1500 per day saving.
THEN there would be the servicing costs of the sails with the longer term cost of replacement of the units. 
Corrosive effects of being seaborne and any subsequent damage, accidental or otherwise.

So all in all, no one aught to expect any financial savings, as there may be even a negative cost involved.
Rather as it is said there are savings in having less pollution. Or rather on PAPER there is.

Of cause there is a formula I have that is:  People = Pollution.

And we cannot get away from the fact that the use of international shipping with or without sails contribute towards an INCREASE of people. 
Therefore more pollution. 
ESPECIALLY there is more pollution if shipping the commodity of OIL, to be used as some form of fuel.
The use of shipping also contributing to the DEVELOPMENT of a Nation and therefore even MORE pollution.

So there may well be a widely acclaimed less CO2 and other toxic substances produced with these wind sails fitted specifically amongst the shipping community.
But long term, there would be even more SHIPPING in terms of number of vessel's and even more pollution caused by the production & use of the particular goods/fuel transported.

On the whole then, when logically looking at these matters I consider it to be a bit of an eco PR gimmick. 
An unsavoury and indeed an unpalatable conclusion it may well be all intere$ted partie$ & well wishers. But this is the truth of the matter that they cannot get away from, no matter their stated intent & public goodwill towards it all.

People = Pollution.
