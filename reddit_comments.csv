That stuff becomes petroleum, diesel, propane, etc. When you're done you have this nasty black sludgy crap full of all the stuff you didn't want in your refined products. No nation on earth will let you burn it within their borders. So what do you do with it?

You call it bunker fuel, is what you do, and you sell it to shipping companies who burn it in international waters. You can offload it for cheap because you just want to get rid of it. The shipping companies will buy it because the giant engines in container ships will run on pretty much anything combustible and they need a _lot_ of fuel so they want the cheapest the can get. It's not being burned within anyone's borders so nobody does anything about it. Who's going to complain, the dolphins? They don't even buy consumer goods!

The only problem is you can't burn it near to shores because then you get in trouble. So the ships have a dual fuel system and switch to diesel close to port.

This one is huge on Reddit. 

It’s a propaganda lie from big oil think tanks. It’s a lie of omission. Yes you are technically having less impact buying any used car over manufacturing any new car. It is *overall* far worse for the environment though because fossil fuel based vehicles will continue to be produced and with a lower demand (the intent of the lie) and we’ll switch over to electric at a slower rate. 

Before the common rebuttal of the infrastructure can’t handle the load they’re right and it will never be upgraded until the demand for it changes. Remaining on fossil fuel is not the answer. We need off the teat of big oil ASAP. 

There’s also the follow up dismissal of nuclear as a power alternative. This has been a HUGE propaganda lie from big oil going back to the 60’s. Waste and danger are the big reasons used. Compared to the alternative which is climate change that will completely decimate the world without immediate intervention the potential damage is irrelevant. Renewable energy is great but even if we focused on changing over to that it would be enough to keep up with our constantly increasing power needs. Batteries also need to get a little better for renewables to work too. There’s a good book I recommend about the grid infrastructure call “The Grid” by Gretchen Baake, Ph.

This is also bullshit. 

Home chargers charge at, at most, 50 amps. 

As of right now, the vast, overwhelming, majority of people charge:

* at home, on 50 amp max chargers, and
* at night, when industrial electrical use has diminished, leading to excess capacity that is usually just spooled down

Chargers can ""refuel"" a vehicle at between 15-35 miles per hour. The average distance driven by the average American per day is approximately 37 miles. This means a 50A (max, it won't actually be that high) draw for between 1-2 hours. More commonly, it's closer to 7200W (~30A, or about the same as an electric water heater switching on). 

50 amps is about the same as running an electric oven and all four burners on an electric range at the same time. 

That's something that most American households do not do every day but which most do on Thanksgiving, for a hell of a lot longer than 1-2 hours. 

The grid does not collapse on Thanksgiving.

Nor does it collapse when everyone gets done watching the superbowl, cleans up, and runs the dishwasher, causing millions of 30A water heaters to switch on simultaneously. 

IF every single driver buys an electric car today and IF they all get home at 5:45 and plug them in at the same time and IF at 5:46 the onboard charger goes ""you know what? I'm gonna pump 50 amps into this sucka right now"" then MAYBE capacity isn't there. But that's not how things work.",-0.3851,economic,electric|right|home|chargers|amps|charge,

&gt;Added weight - reduced buoyancy and carrying capacity.  
&gt;  
&gt;Added hull stresses - you need to secure tall heavy poles so that they are completely rigid and not free to move.  
&gt;  
&gt;Higher freeboard - can't fit under some bridges  
&gt;  
&gt;Higher center of gravity - horrible for stability.  
&gt;  
&gt;Wind forces acting high up on the ship - horrible for stability.  
&gt;  
&gt;Extra drag - primarily when stowed away but also with unfavorable winds.  
&gt;  
&gt;Volume - they take up considerable space both in use and when secured, meaning both that less cargo can be carried and that it is more difficult/impossible to do any operations near them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Increased manning - more crew members would be needed to operate the sails and/or do maintenance on them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Harder to automate - harder to implement into a ship's autopilot as well as just to hook it up to manual remote controls.  
&gt;  
&gt;Unpredictability - ships run on strict schedules, adding more variance to the process would affect fuel calculations, ETA's, routes, etc.

---

&gt;A shipping vessel left China for Brazil while sporting some new improvements last August—a pair of 123-feet-tall, solid “wings” retrofitted atop its deck to harness wind power for propulsion assistance. But after its six-week maiden voyage testing the green energy tech, the Pyxis Ocean MC Shipping Kamsarmax vessel apparently had many more trips ahead of it. Six months later, its owners at the shipping company, Cargill, shared the results of those journeys this week—and it sounds like the vertical WindWing sails could offer a promising way to reduce existing vessels’ emissions.

&gt;Using the wind force captured by its two giant, controllable sails to boost its speed, Pyxis Ocean reportedly saved an average of 3.3 tons of fuel each day. And in optimal weather conditions, its trips through portions of the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans reduced fuel consumption by over 12 tons a day. According to Cargill’s math, that’s an average of 14 percent less greenhouse gas emissions from the ship. On its best days, Pyxis Ocean could cut that down by 37 percent. In all, the WindWing’s average performance fell within 10 percent ts designers’ computational fluid dynamics simulation predictions.

And call it 5% if they add the third sail mentioned in the article.


Per the link below, ship life cycle is 35-50y so that still nets 17-25 million (or 25-38 million with the additional sail) over the ship lifetime, and that's assuming fuel prices don't shoot up at some point.

But after its six-week maiden voyage testing the green energy tech, the Pyxis Ocean MC Shipping Kamsarmax vessel apparently had many more trips ahead of it. Six months later, its owners at the shipping company, Cargill, shared the results of those journeys this week—and it sounds like the vertical WindWing sails could offer a promising way to reduce existing vessels’ emissions.

&gt;Using the wind force captured by its two giant, controllable sails to boost its speed, Pyxis Ocean reportedly saved an average of 3.3 tons of fuel each day. And in optimal weather conditions, its trips through portions of the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans reduced fuel consumption by over 12 tons a day. According to Cargill’s math, that’s an average of 14 percent less greenhouse gas emissions from the ship. On its best days, Pyxis Ocean could cut that down by 37 percent.

&gt;So I guess the equivalent of about 1 less hurricane per year, worth of reduced storm energy?

First and foremost, no energy is ever removed from a system, it is only converted.

But that is the most disjointed and ridiculous thing I have read on reddit in a very long time. Just because you have numbers to calculate does not mean those numbers belong in the same formula.

The energy harnessed by a wind-powered vessel is relatively minuscule. Wind power is a function of the cube of wind speed, the air density, and the swept area of the wind capturing device (such as these ""sails"". Even for large vessels with significant sail areas, like tankers, the energy captured is only a tiny fraction of the wind's total energy as it passes by.

The difference in scale between the energy harnessed by wind-powered ships and the energy contained in atmospheric systems, including hurricanes, is enormous. Atmospheric dynamics and hurricane formation are driven by vast amounts of energy primarily from solar heating of the Earth's surface and oceans, not the minute fraction of wind energy captured by ships.

***It is not a net zero system AND these are two disparate systems and usages of energy.***

""1 less hurricane per year""... Jesus, I have heard it all.

&gt;Like... would it be enough to reduce storm/hurricane intensity around the globe?! (Which if so could also be another environmental benefit.)

I just want to point out that storms do not harm the environment in any way shape or form, they harm the human habitats. The same as climate change does not harm the Earth, climate change harms the human habitat.

Edit: The OP deleted his comment. I was responding to his claim that if all ships had these sails, it would result in one less hurricane per year and they did some silly disjointed calculations to back it up.",0.9805,operational,energy|hurricane|wind|less|per|year,
